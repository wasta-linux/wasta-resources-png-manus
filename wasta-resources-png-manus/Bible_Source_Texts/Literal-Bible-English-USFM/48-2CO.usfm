\s5
\c 1
\p
\v 1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is in Corinth, and to all the saints in the entire region of Achaia:
\v 2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\b

\s5
\p
\v 3 May the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ be blessed, who is the Father of mercies and God of all comfort,
\v 4 who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we are able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the same comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.

\s5
\v 5 For just as the sufferings of Christ abound for our sake, so also our comfort abounds through Christ.
\v 6 But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation. Or if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which works when you patiently share in the same sufferings that we also suffer.
\v 7 And our confidence for you is certain, knowing that as you also share the sufferings, you also share the comfort.

\s5
\v 8 For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, about the troubles we had in Asia: we were completely crushed beyond what we could bear, so much that we did not even hope to live any longer.
\v 9  Indeed, we had the sentence of death on us. But that was to make us not put our trust in ourselves, but instead in God, who raises the dead.
\v 10 He rescued us from such a deadly peril, and he will rescue us again. We have set our confidence in him that yet again, he will deliver us.

\s5
\v 11 He will do this as you also help us by your prayer. Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the gracious favor given to us through the prayers of many.

\s5
\p
\v 12 Now this is what we are proud of: the testimony of our conscience, which is that we have conducted ourselves in the world—and especially in dealing with you—with the holiness and sincerity that come from God, not according to earthly wisdom but by the grace of God.
\v 13 We do not write to you anything you cannot read or understand—and I am confident, 
\v 14 as you already understand us in part, that on the day of our Lord Jesus we will be your reason for pride, just as you will be ours.

\s5
\p
\v 15 Because I was confident about this, I wanted to come to you first, that you might receive the benefit of two visits.
\v 16 I was planning to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and then visit you again on my trip from Macedonia, and then for you to send me on my way to Judea.

\s5
\v 17 When I was thinking this way, did I vacillate? Or do I plan things according to human standards, so that I say "Yes, yes" and "No, no" at the same time?
\v 18 But just as God is faithful, we do not say both "Yes" and "No."

\s5
\v 19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom Silvanus, Timothy and I proclaimed among you, is  not "Yes" and "No," but is always "Yes."
\v 20 For all the promises of God are "Yes" in him.   So also through him we say "Amen" to the glory of God.

\s5
\v 21 Now it is God who confirms us with you in Christ, and he commissioned us.
\v 22 He set his seal on us and gave us the Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee of what he would later give us.

\s5
\p
\v 23 But I call God to bear witness for me that the reason I did not come to Corinth was so that I might spare you.
\v 24 Not because we are trying to control what your faith should be, but we are working with you for your joy, as you stand in your faith.





\s5
\c 2
\nb
\v 1 So I decided for my own part that I would not again come to you in painful circumstances.
\v 2 If I caused you pain, who could cheer me up but the very one who was hurt by me? 

\s5
\v 3 And I wrote as I did so that when I came to you I might not be hurt by those who should have made me rejoice. I have confidence about all of you that my joy is the same joy you all have.
\v 4 For I wrote to you from great affliction, with anguish of heart, and with many tears, not wanting to cause you pain, but so you would know the depth of the love that I have for you.

\s5
\p
\v 5 If anyone has caused pain, he has not caused it only to me, but in some measure—not to put it too harshly—to all of you.
\v 6 This punishment of that person by the majority is enough.
\v 7 So now rather than punishment, you should forgive and comfort him, so that he is not overwhelmed by too much sorrow.

\s5
\v 8 So I encourage you to publicly affirm your love for him.
\v 9 This was the reason I wrote, so that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything.

\s5
\v 10 If you forgive anyone, I forgive that person as well. What I have forgiven—if I have forgiven anything—it is forgiven for your sake in the presence of Christ.
\v 11 This is so that Satan will not trick us. For we are not ignorant of his plans.

\s5
\p
\v 12 Though a door was opened to me by the Lord when I came to the city of Troas to preach the gospel of Christ there, 
\v 13 I had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I left them and returned to Macedonia.

\s5
\p
\v 14 But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumph, and through us spreads the sweet aroma of the knowledge of him everywhere.
\v 15 For we are to God the sweet aroma of Christ, both among those who are saved and among those who are perishing.

\s5
\v 16 To the people who are perishing, it is an aroma from death to death. To the ones being saved, it is an aroma from life to life. Who is worthy of these things?
\v 17 For we are not like so many people who sell the word of God for profit. Instead, with purity of motives, as sent from God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ.





\s5
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Are we beginning to praise ourselves again? We do not need letters of recommendation to you or from you, like some people, do we?
\v 2 You yourselves are our letter of recommendation, written on our hearts, known and read by all people.
\v 3 And you show that you are a letter from Christ, delivered by us, written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts.

\s5
\v 4 And this is the confidence that we have in God  through Christ.
\v 5 Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us, but our adequacy is from God,
\v 6 who also qualified us to be servants of a new covenant—not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.

\s5
\v 7 Now if the service of death that was engraved in letters on stones came in such glory that the people of Israel could not look directly at Moses' face, because of the glory of his face, a glory that was fading,
\v 8 will not the service of the Spirit be even more glorious?

\s5
\v 9 For if the service of condemnation had glory, how much more does the service of righteousness abound in glory!
\v 10 For indeed, that which was once made glorious is no longer glorious in this respect, because of the glory that exceeds it.
\v 11 For if that which was passing away had glory, how much more will what is permanent have glory!

\s5
\p
\v 12 Since we have such confidence, we are very bold,
\v 13 not like Moses, who put a veil over his face, so that the people of Israel were not able to look directly at the ending of a glory that was passing away.

\s5
\v 14 But their minds were closed. Even until this very day the same veil remains on the reading of the old covenant; it is not opened up, because only in Christ is it done away with.
\v 15 But even today, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their hearts.
\v 16 But when a person turns to the Lord, the veil is lifted away.

\s5
\v 17 Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
\v 18 Now all of us, with unveiled faces, seeing the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same glorious likeness from one degree of glory into another, just as this is from the Lord, who is the Spirit.





\s5
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Therefore, because we have this ministry, and  just as we have received mercy, we do not become discouraged.
\v 2 Instead, we have renounced the ways that are shameful and hidden. We do not live by craftiness, and we do not mishandle the word of God. By presenting the truth, we recommend ourselves to everyone’s conscience in the sight of God.

\s5
\v 3 But if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled only to those who are perishing.
\v 4 In their case, the god of this world has blinded their unbelieving minds so they are not able to see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.

\s5
\v 5 For we do not proclaim ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.
\v 6 For God is the one who said, "Light will shine out of darkness," and he has shone in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the presence of Jesus Christ.

\s5
\p
\v 7 But we have this treasure in jars of clay, so that it is clear that the exceedingly great power belongs to God and not to us.
\v 8 We are afflicted in every way, but not overwhelmed. We are perplexed but not filled with despair;
\v 9 persecuted but not forsaken; struck down but not destroyed.
\v 10 We always carry in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus also may be shown in our bodies.

\s5
\v 11 We who are alive are always being handed over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus may be shown in our human bodies.
\v 12 For this reason, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.

\s5
\v 13 But we have the same spirit of faith according to that which was written: "I believed, and so I spoke." We also believe, and so we also speak.
\v 14 We know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with him, and will bring us with you into his presence.
\v 15 Everything is for your sake so that, as grace is spread to many people, thanksgiving may increase to the glory of God.

\s5
\p
\v 16 So we do not become discouraged. Even though outwardly we are wasting away, inwardly we are being renewed day by day.
\v 17 For this momentary, light affliction  is preparing us for an eternal weight of glory that exceeds all measurement.
\v 18 For we are not watching for things that are seen, but for things which are unseen. The things which we can see are temporary, but the things which are unseen are eternal.





\s5
\c 5
\p
\v 1 We know that if the earthly dwelling that we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made by human hands, but an eternal house, in heaven.
\v 2 For in this tent we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling—
\v 3 because by putting it on we will not be found naked.

\s5
\v 4 For indeed while we are in this tent, we groan, being burdened—not that we want to be unclothed, but wanting to be clothed, so that what is mortal may be absorbed by life.
\v 5 The one who prepared us for this very thing is God, who gave us the Spirit as a pledge of what is to come.

\s5
\v 6 Therefore always be confident; be aware that while we are at home in the body, we are away from the Lord
\v 7 (for we walk by faith, not by sight).
\v 8 So we have confidence; we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord.

\s5
\v 9 So we make it our goal, whether we are at home or away, to please him.
\v 10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for the things done in the body, whether for good or for bad.

\s5
\p
\v 11 Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade people. What we are is clearly seen by God, and I expect that it is also clear to your consciences.
\v 12 We are not recommending ourselves to you again, but we are giving you a reason to be proud of us, so you may have an answer for those who boast about appearances but not about what is in the heart.

\s5
\v 13 For if we are out of our minds, it is for God; and if we are in our right minds, it is for your sake.
\v 14 For the love of Christ compels us, because we are certain of this: that one person died for all, and that therefore all have died.
\v 15 And Christ died for all, so that those who live should live no longer for themselves but for him who died and was raised.

\s5
\v 16 For this reason, from now on we do not judge anyone according to human standards, even though we once regarded Christ in this way. But now we do not judge anyone in this way any longer.
\v 17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away; see, it has become new.

\s5
\v 18 All these things are from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave us the ministry of reconciliation;
\v 19 that is, in Christ God is reconciling the world to himself, not counting their sinful stumblings against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.

\s5
\p
\v 20 So we are appointed as representatives of Christ, as though God were making his appeal through us. We plead with you, for the sake of Christ: "Be reconciled to God!"
\v 21 He made Christ become the sacrifice for our sin—the one who never sinned—so that in Christ we might become the righteousness of God.





\s5
\c 6
\nb
\v 1 And so, working together, we beg you not to receive the grace of God to no effect.  
\v 2 For he says,
\q "In a favorable time I paid attention to you,
\q And in the day of salvation I helped you."
\m Look, now is the favorable time; look, now is the day of salvation.
\v 3 We do not place a stumbling block in front of anyone, for we do not wish our ministry to be brought into disrepute.

\s5
\v 4 Instead, we prove ourselves by all our actions,  that we are God's servants—in much endurance, affliction, distress, hardship,
\v 5 beatings, imprisonments, riots, in hard work, in sleepless nights, in hunger,
\v 6 in purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in genuine love;
\v 7 in the word of truth, in the power of God—with the armor of righteousness for the right hand and for the left.

\s5
\v 8 We work in honor and dishonor, in slander and praise. We are accused of being deceitful and yet we are truthful.
\v 9 We work as if we were unknown and yet well known; as dying and—see!—yet living; as punished for our actions but not as condemned to death.
\v 10 We work as sorrowful but are always rejoicing; as poor but making many rich; as having nothing and yet as possessing all things.

\s5
\p
\v 11 We have spoken the whole truth to you, Corinthians, and our heart is wide open.
\v 12 Your hearts are not restrained by us, but you are restrained by your own feelings.
\v 13 Now in fair exchange—I speak as to children—open your hearts wide.

\s5
\v 14 Do not be tied together with unbelievers. For what association does righteousness have with lawlessness? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?
\v 15 What agreement can Christ have with Beliar? Or what share does a believer have together with an unbeliever?
\v 16 And what agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God, just as God said,
\q "I will dwell among them and walk among them;
\q I will be their God, 
\q1 and they will be my people."
\m

\s5
\v 17 Therefore, 
\q "Come out from among them, 
\q1 and be set apart," says the Lord,
\q "and touch no unclean thing,
\q1 and I will welcome you.
\q
\v 18 I will be a Father to you,
\q and you will be my sons and daughters,"
\m says the Lord Almighty.





\s5
\c 7
\nb
\v 1 Loved ones, since we have these promises let us cleanse ourselves of everything that makes us unclean in our body and spirit, as we pursue holiness in the fear of God. 

\s5
\p
\v 2 Make room for us! We have not wronged anyone, nor have we harmed anyone or taken advantage of anyone.
\v 3 I do not say this to condemn you, for I have already said that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together.
\v 4 I have great confidence in you, and I am proud of you. I am filled with comfort,  and I overflow with joy even in all our afflictions.

\s5
\p
\v 5 When we came to Macedonia, our bodies had no rest; instead, we were troubled in every way—conflicts on the outside and fears on the inside.
\v 6 But God, who comforts the discouraged, comforted us by the arrival of Titus,
\v 7 and not only by his arrival, but also by the comfort he had received from you, when he told us of your great affection, your sorrow, and your deep concern for me; so I rejoiced even more.

\s5
\v 8 Even if my letter made you sad, I do not regret it—though I did regret it when I saw my letter made you sad, but sad just for a little while—
\v 9 and now I rejoice, not that you were distressed, but that your sadness brought you to repentance. You experienced a godly sorrow, so you suffered no loss because of us.
\v 10 For godly sorrow brings about repentance that accomplishes salvation without regret; worldly sorrow, however, brings about death.

\s5
\v 11 See what great determination this godly sorrow produced in you—what great determination in you to prove you were innocent, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, and what desire to see that justice should be done! In everything you proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter.
\v 12 Although I wrote to you, I did not write for the sake of the wrongdoer, nor for the one who suffered the wrong, but so that your earnestness for us should be made known to you in the sight of God.

\s5
\v 13 By this we are encouraged.
\p
In addition to our own comfort, we also rejoiced even more because of Titus' joy, because his spirit was refreshed by all of you.
\v 14 For if I have boasted to him about you, I was not put to shame. On the contrary, just as everything we said to you was true, our boasting about you to Titus proved to be true. 

\s5
\v 15 And his affection for you is even greater, as he remembers the obedience of you all, as you welcomed him with fear and trembling.
\v 16 I rejoice because I have complete confidence in you.





\s5
\c 8
\p
\v 1 We want you to know, brothers and sisters,  about the grace of God that has been given to the churches of Macedonia,
\v 2 that during a great test of affliction, the abundance of their joy and the extremity of their poverty has overflowed into the riches of their generosity.

\s5
\v 3 For they gave as much as they were able, I bear witness, and even beyond what they were able. And of their own free will
\v 4 with much begging they pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this ministry to the saints.
\v 5 And this happened not as we had expected, but first they gave themselves to the Lord, and then, by the will of God, to us.

\s5
\v 6 So we urged Titus, who had already begun the task with you, to bring to completion this act of grace on your part.
\v 7 But as you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us—make sure you also excel in this gracious work.

\s5
\v 8 I say this not as a command, but to prove the sincerity of your love by comparing it to the diligence of other people.
\v 9 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that even though he was rich, for your sakes he became poor, so that through his poverty you might become rich.

\s5
\v 10 In this matter I will give you advice about what will help you: one year ago, you not only started to do something, but you desired to do it.
\v 11 Now finish doing it. So just as there was an eagerness and desire to do it then, you also may bring it to completion, as you are able.
\v 12 For if an eagerness to do this work exists, it is a good and acceptable thing, based on what a person has, not on what he does not have.

\s5
\v 13 For this task is not so others may be relieved and you may be burdened. But there should be fairness.
\v 14 Your abundance at the current time will supply what they need. This is also so that their abundance may also supply your need, and so that there may be fairness,
\v 15 as it is written, 
\q "The one with much did not have anything left over; 
\q1 but the one who had little did not have any lack."
\m

\s5
\p
\v 16 But thanks be to God, who put into Titus' heart the same earnest care that I have for you.
\v 17 For he not only accepted our appeal, but being very earnest about it, he came to you of his own free will.

\s5
\v 18 And we have sent with him the brother who is praised among all of the churches for his work in proclaiming the gospel. 
\v 19 Not only this, but he also was selected by the churches to travel with us to carry out this act of grace for the glory of the Lord himself and to show our eagerness to help.
\s5
\v 20 We are avoiding the possibility that anyone should find a cause to complain about this generous gift we are collecting. 
\v 21 We take care to do what is honorable, not only before the Lord, but also before people. 

\s5
\v 22 And with them we send still another brother whom we have often tested and found enthusiastic in many tasks, but who is now even more diligent because of the great confidence he has in you.
\v 23 As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you. Concerning our brothers, they are sent by the churches, an honor to Christ.
\v 24 So show them your love, and show them why we boasted about you among the other churches.





\s5
\c 9
\p
\v 1 Concerning the ministry for the saints, it is not necessary for me to write to you.
\v 2 I know about your desire, which I boasted about to the people of Macedonia. I told them that Achaia has been getting ready since last year. Your zeal has motivated most of them to action.

\s5
\v 3 Now I have sent the brothers so that our boasting about you may not be futile, and so that you would be ready, as I said you would be.
\v 4 Otherwise, if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we would be put to shame—I say nothing about you—for being so confident in you.
\v 5 So I thought it was necessary to urge the brothers to come to you and to make arrangements in advance for the gift you have promised. This is so that it might be ready as a freely offered gift, and not because you are forced to give it.

\s5
\p
\v 6 The point is this: the one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.
\v 7 Let each one give as he has planned in his heart—not so as to have sorrow when you give, and not out of a compelling obligation—for God loves a cheerful giver.

\s5
\v 8 And God is able to make all grace increase in you, so that, always, in all things, having all you need, you may increase in every good deed.
\v 9 As it is written,
\q "He has distributed his riches and given them to the poor;
\q1 His righteousness lasts forever."
\m

\s5
\v 10 He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food, will also supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness.
\v 11 You will be enriched in every way so you can be generous, and this will bring about thanksgiving to God through us.

\s5
\v 12 For the ministry of this service not only meets the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God.
\v 13 You have been approved by this service; you also glorify God by the obedience of your confession of the gospel of Christ, and the generosity of your gift to them and to all.
\v 14 And they long for you as they are praying for you, because of the exceedingly great grace of God that is upon you.
\v 15 Thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift!





\s5
\c 10
\p
\v 1 I, Paul, myself appeal to you, by the humility and gentleness of Christ—I who am meek when in your presence, but bold toward you when away—
\v 2 I beg of you that, when I am present with you, I will not need to be bold with self-confidence, as I think I will have to be, when I oppose those who suppose that we are living according to the flesh.

\s5
\v 3 For even though we walk in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh.
\v 4 For the weapons we fight with are not fleshly.  Instead, they have divine power to destroy strongholds—bringing to nothing misleading arguments.

\s5
\v 5 We also destroy every lofty thing that rises up against the knowledge of God, and we take every thought captive for obedience to Christ.
\v 6 And we prepare to punish every act of disobedience, when your obedience is complete.

\s5
\v 7 Look at what is clearly in front of you. If anyone is convinced that he is Christ’s, let him remind himself that just as he is Christ's, so also are we.
\v 8 For even if I boast a little too much about our authority, which the Lord gave to build you up and not to destroy you, I will not be ashamed.

\s5
\v 9 And I do not want it to appear that I am terrifying you by my letters.
\v 10 For some people say, "His letters are serious and powerful, but physically he is weak and his speech is not worth listening to."

\s5
\v 11 Let such people understand that what we say by letter when we are away, is the same as we will do when we are there.
\v 12 We do not go so far as to classify or compare ourselves with those who praise themselves. But when they measure themselves by one another and compare themselves with each other, they have no insight.

\s5
\v 13 We, however, will not boast beyond limits, but we will keep in the area that God has assigned to us, even to reach as far as to you.
\v 14 For we did not overextend ourselves when we reached you, and we were the first to reach as far as you with the gospel of Christ.

\s5
\v 15 We do not boast—beyond the limits—about the labors of others, but we hope as your faith grows that our own area of work will be greatly expanded,
\v 16 so that we may preach the gospel even in regions beyond you. We will not boast about the work being done in another's area.

\s5
\v 17 
\q "But let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord."
\m
\v 18 For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but it is the one the Lord commends.





\s5
\c 11
\p
\v 1 I wish that you could put up with me in some foolishness—but you are indeed putting up with me!
\v 2 For I am jealous about you—I have a godly jealousy for you, since I promised you in marriage to one husband—to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.

\s5
\v 3 But I am afraid that somehow—as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness—your thoughts might be led astray away from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ.
\v 4 For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we preached, or if you receive a different spirit than what you received, or a different gospel than the one you received, you tolerate it well enough!

\s5
\v 5 For I think that I am not in the least inferior to those "super-apostles."
\v 6 But even if I am untrained in giving speeches, I am not untrained in knowledge. In every way and in all things we made this known to you.

\s5
\v 7 Did I sin by humbling myself so you might be exalted, because I freely preached the gospel of God to you?
\v 8 I "robbed" other churches, accepting support from them so that I could serve you.
\v 9 And when I was with you and I was in need, I did not burden anyone. For the brothers who came from  Macedonia provided what I needed. And in every way I kept myself from being a burden to you, and I will continue to do that.

\s5
\v 10 As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be silenced in the parts of Achaia.
\v 11 And why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do.

\s5
\v 12 But what I am doing, I also will do in the future, so that I might cut off the excuse of those who wish to be found equal to us in what they boast about.  
\v 13 For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.

\s5
\v 14 And this is no surprise, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.
\v 15 It is no great surprise if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their fate will be what their deeds deserve.

\s5
\p
\v 16 I say again: Let no one think I am a fool. But if you do, receive me like a fool so I may boast a little.
\v 17 What I am saying about this boastful confidence is not condoned by the Lord, but I speak as a fool.
\v 18 Since many people boast according to the flesh, I will also boast.

\s5
\v 19 For you gladly put up with fools, being wise yourselves!
\v 20 For you put up with someone if he enslaves you, if he causes division among you, if he takes advantage of you, if he puts on airs, or if he slaps you in the face.
\v 21 I speak out of shame for we were too weak to do that. Yet whenever anyone boasts—I am speaking like a fool—I also boast.

\s5
\v 22 Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.
\v 23 Are they servants of Christ? (I speak as though I were out of my mind) I am more—in even more hard work, in far more prisons, in beatings beyond measure, in facing many dangers of death.

\s5
\v 24 From Jews I received five times the "forty lashes minus one."
\v 25 Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked. I have spent a night and a day on the open sea;
\v 26 on frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, in danger from robbers, in danger from my own people, in danger from the Gentiles, in danger in the city, in danger in the wilderness, in danger at sea, in danger from false brothers.

\s5
\v 27 I have been at hard work and in hardship, in many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, and nothing to eat, in cold and nakedness.
\v 28 And, apart from everything else, there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for all the churches.
\v 29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who has caused another to fall into sin, and I do not burn within?

\s5
\v 30 If I must boast, I will boast about what shows my weaknesses.
\v 31 The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, the one who is praised forever, knows I am not lying!

\s5
\p
\v 32 At Damascus, the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of Damascus to arrest me,
\v 33 but I was lowered in a basket through a window in the wall and I escaped from his hands.





\s5
\c 12
\p
\v 1 I must boast, but nothing is gained by it. But I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord.
\v 2 I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago—whether in the body or out of the body, I do not know, God knows—was caught up into the third heaven.

\s5
\v 3 And I know such a man—whether in the body, or out of the body, I do not know, God knows—
\v 4 who was caught up into paradise and who heard things too sacred for anyone to say.
\v 5 On behalf of such a person I will boast, but on behalf of myself I will not boast, except of my weaknesses.

\s5
\v 6 If I wanted to boast, I would not be foolish, for I would be speaking the truth; but I will keep from boasting, so that no one may think more of me than what is seen in me or heard from me,
\v 7 or because of the extraordinary nature of the revelations. Therefore, so I would not be puffed up with pride, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger from Satan to harass me, so I would not become overly proud.

\s5
\v 8 Three times I begged the Lord about this, that he might take it from me.
\v 9 And he said to me, "My grace is enough for you, for power is made perfect in weakness." So I would much rather boast about my weakness, so that the power of Christ might rest on me.
\v 10 Therefore I am content for Christ’s sake, in weaknesses, in insults, in troubles, in persecutions, in distresses, for whenever I am weak, then I am strong.

\s5
\p
\v 11 I have become a fool! You forced me to be, for I should have been praised by you, for I was not at all inferior to the "super-apostles," even though I am nothing.
\v 12 The true signs of an apostle were performed among you with all patience—signs and wonders and mighty deeds.
\v 13 For how were you less important than the rest of the churches, except that I was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!

\s5
\p
\v 14 See! I am ready to come to you a third time, and I will not be a burden to you, for I do not want what is yours—I want you. For children should not save up for the parents, but the parents should save up for the children.
\v 15 I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less?

\s5
\v 16 But as it is, I did not burden you, but, since I am so crafty, I am the one who caught you by deceit.
\v 17 Did I take advantage of you by anyone I sent to you?
\v 18 I urged Titus to go to you, and I sent the other brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same way? Did we not take the same steps?

\s5
\p
\v 19 Do you think all of this time we have been defending ourselves to you? In the sight of God, we have in Christ been saying everything for your upbuilding.

\s5
\v 20 For I am afraid that when I come I may not find you as I wish, and that you might not find me as you wish—that there may be arguments, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, gossip, pride, and disorder.
\v 21 I am afraid that when I come back, my God might humble me before you, and I might mourn for many of them that have sinned before now, and did not repent from the impurity and sexual immorality and lustful indulgence which they practiced.





\s5
\c 13
\p
\v 1 This is the third time that I am coming to you.  "Every charge must be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses."
\v 2 I have already said to those who sinned before and to all the rest when I was there the second time, and I say it again: If I come again, I will not spare them.

\s5
\v 3 I tell you this because you are seeking evidence  that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak toward you; instead, he is powerful in you.
\v 4 For he was crucified in weakness, but he is alive by God's power. For we also are weak in him, but we will live with him by the power of God among you.

\s5
\v 5 Examine yourselves to see if you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not realize that Jesus Christ is in you? He is, unless you are not approved.
\v 6 And I am confident that you will find that we are not unapproved.

\s5
\v 7 Now we pray to God that you may not do wrong, not so we may appear to have passed the test, but that you may do what is right, though we may seem to have failed the test.
\v 8 For we are not able to do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.

\s5
\v 9 For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong. We also pray that you may be made complete.
\v 10 I write these things while I am away from you, so that when I am with you I do not have to act harshly toward you, using the authority the Lord gave me to build you up and not tear you down.

\s5
\p
\v 11 Finally, brothers and sisters, rejoice! Work for restoration, be encouraged, agree with one another, live in peace: and the God of love and peace will be with you.
\v 12 Greet each other with a holy kiss.

\s5
\p
\v 13 All of the saints greet you.
\p
\v 14 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.
