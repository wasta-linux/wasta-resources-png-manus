\mt The Gospel According to Saint John 




\s5
\c 1
\p
\v 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
\v 2 This one, the Word, was in the beginning with God.
\v 3 All things were made through him, and without him there was not one thing made that has been made.

\s5
\v 4 In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind.
\v 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not extinguish it. 

\s5
\v 6 There was a man who was sent from God, whose name was John.
\v 7 He came as a witness to testify about the light, that all might believe through him.
\v 8 John was not the light, but came that he might testify about the light.

\s5
\v 9 That was the true light that was coming into the world and that illumines everyone.


\s5
\v 10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world did not know him.
\v 11 He came to what was his own things, and his own people did not receive him.

\s5
\v 12 But to as many as did receive him, who believed on his name, to these he gave the right to become children of God,
\v 13 who were born, not by blood, nor by the will of the flesh, nor by the will of man, but by God.

\s5
\v 14 Now the Word became flesh and lived among us. We have seen his glory, glory as of the only unique person who came from the Father,
full of grace and truth.
\v 15 John testified about him and cried out saying, "This was the one of whom I said, 'The one who comes after me ranks before me,
for he was before me.'"

\s5
\v 16 For from his fullness we have all received free gift after free gift.
\v 17 For the law was given through Moses, and grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
\v 18 No man has seen God at any time. The one and only person, himself God, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known.

\s5
\p
\v 19 Now this is John's testimony, when the Jews sent to him from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him, "Who are you?"
\v 20 He freely stated, and did not deny, but replied, "I am not the Christ."
\v 21 So they asked him, "What are you then? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." They said, "Are you the prophet?"  He answered, "No."

\s5
\v 22 Then they said to him, "Who are you, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?"
\v 23 He said, 
\q "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness:
\q  'Make the way of the Lord straight,' 
\m
just as Isaiah the prophet said."

\s5
\v 24 Now there were ones sent there from the Pharisees. They asked him and said to him, 
\v 25 "Why do you baptize then if you are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the prophet?"

\s5
\v 26 John replied to them saying, "I baptize with water. However, in the midst of you stands one whom you do not recognize.
\v 27 This is the one who is coming after me. I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandal."

\v 28 These things were done in Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

\s5
\v 29 The next day John saw Jesus coming to him and said, "Look, there is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!
\v 30 This is the one of whom I said, 'The one who comes after me ranks before me, for he was before me.'
\v 31 I did not recognize him, but it was so that he could be revealed to Israel that I came baptizing with water."

\s5
\v 32 John testified, "I saw the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and it remained upon him.
\v 33 I did not recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water said to me, 'Upon whom you shall see the Spirit 
descending and remaining on him, that one is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.'
\v 34 I have both seen and testified that this is the Son of God."

\s5
\p
\v 35 Again, the next day, as John was standing with two of his disciples,
\v 36 they saw Jesus walking by, and John said, "Look, there is the Lamb of God!"

\s5
\v 37 The two disciples heard John say this, and they followed Jesus.
\v 38 Then Jesus turned and saw them following him and said to them, "What do you want?" They replied, "Rabbi (which means 'teacher'), where are you staying?"
\v 39 He said to them, "Come and see." Then they came and saw where he was staying; they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.

\s5
\v 40 One of the two who heard John speak and then followed Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.
\v 41 He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, "We have found the Messiah" (which is translated, 'the
Christ').
\v 42 He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon, the son of John. You will be called Cephas" (which means 'Peter').

\s5
\p
\v 43 The next day, when Jesus wanted to leave to go to Galilee, he found Philip and said to him, "Follow me."
\v 44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
\v 45 Philip found Nathaniel and said to him, "The one of whom Moses in the law and the prophets wrote—we have found him, Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth."

\s5
\v 46 Nathaniel said to him, "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?" Philip said to him, "Come and see."
\v 47 Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and said about him, "See, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!"
\v 48 Nathaniel said to him, "How do you know me?" Jesus answered and said to him, "Before Philip called you, when you
were under the fig tree, I saw you."

\s5
\v 49 Nathaniel replied, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!"
\v 50 Jesus replied and said to him, "Because I said to you, 'I saw you underneath the fig tree,' do you believe? You
will see greater things than this."
\v 51 Jesus said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see the heavens opened, and the angels of God ascending
and descending upon the Son of Man."




\s5
\c 2
\p
\v 1 The third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.
\v 2 Jesus also was invited, and his disciples, to the wedding.

\s5
\v 3 When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, "They have no wine."
\v 4 Jesus replied, "Woman, what does that have to do with me? My time has not yet come."
\v 5 His mother said to the servants, "Whatever he says to you, do it."

\s5
\v 6 Now there were six stone water pots there used for the Jews’ ceremonial washing, containing two to three metretes apiece.
\v 7 Jesus said to them, "Fill the water pots with water." So they filled them up to the brim.
\v 8 Then he told the servants, "Take some out now and take it to the head waiter." So they did.

\s5
\v 9 The head waiter tasted the water that had become wine, but he did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew). Then he called the bridegroom
\v 10 and said to him, "Every man places first the good wine and then the cheaper wine when men are drunk.  But you have kept the fine wine until now."

\s5
\v 11 This miracle in Cana of Galilee was the beginning of miraculous signs that Jesus did, revealing his glory, so his disciples believed in him.

\s5
\v 12 After this he went down to Capernaum, he, his mother, his brothers, and his disciples, and there they stayed for a few days.

\s5
\p
\v 13 Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, so Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\v 14 He found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and pigeons. The money changers were sitting there also.

\s5
\v 15 So he made a whip of cords and drove all of them out from the temple, including both the sheep and the oxen. He poured out the money
changers’ money and overthrew their tables.
\v 16  To the pigeon sellers, he said, "Take these things away from here. Stop making my Father’s house a marketplace."

\s5
\v 17 His disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal for your house will consume me."
\v 18 Then the Jewish authorities responded, saying to him, "What sign will you show us because you are doing these things?"
\v 19 Jesus replied, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."

\s5
\v 20 Then the Jewish authorities said, "It took forty-six years to build this temple, and you will raise it up in three days?"
\v 21 However, he spoke of the temple of his body.
\v 22 So then afterwards when he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed the scripture and this statement that Jesus had spoken.

\s5
\p
\v 23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name, seeing the miraculous signs that he did.
\v 24 Nevertheless, Jesus would not trust himself to them because he knew all people
\v 25 and because he did not need anyone to testify concerning mankind. He himself knew what was in mankind.





\s5
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Now there was a Pharisee whose name was Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish Council.
\v 2 This man came to Jesus at night time and said to him, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God for no one can do
these signs that you do unless God is with him."

\s5
\v 3 Jesus replied to him, "Truly, truly, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."
\v 4 Nicodemus said to him, "How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be
born, can he?"

\s5
\v 5 Jesus replied, "Truly, truly, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
\v 6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.

\s5
\v 7 Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'
\v 8 The wind blows wherever it wishes. You hear its sound, but you do not know where it came from or where it is 
going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit."

\s5
\v 9 Nicodemus replied, saying, "How can these things be?"
\v 10 Jesus answered him, "Are you a teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things?
\v 11 Truly, truly, we speak that which we know, and we testify of that which we have seen. Yet you people do not accept
our testimony.

\s5
\v 12 If I told you people about earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
\v 13 No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man.

\s5
\v 14 As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so the Son of Man must be lifted up
\v 15 so that all who believe in him may have everlasting life.

\s5
\p
\v 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only unique Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but
have everlasting life.
\v 17 For God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but so that the world should be saved through him.
\v 18 He who believes in him is not condemned. He who does not believe has been condemned already because he has not believed in
the name of the unique Son of God.

\s5
\v 19 This is the reason for the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light because
their works were evil.
\v 20 For everyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light so that his deeds might not be exposed.
\v 21 However, he who practices the truth comes to the light so that his deeds may be clearly seen and that they have been brought about in obedience to God."

\s5
\p
\v 22 After this, Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judea. There he was spending time with them and was baptizing.
\v 23 Now John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim because there was much water there. People were coming to him and were being baptized, 
\v 24 for John had not yet been thrown into prison.

\s5
\v 25 Then there arose a dispute between some of John’s disciples and a Jew about ceremonial washing.
\v 26 They went to John and said to him, "Rabbi, the one who was with you on the other side of the Jordan River, about whom you have testified, see, he is baptizing, and all are going to him."

\s5
\v 27 John replied, "A man cannot receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven.
\v 28 You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ' but rather that I said, 'I have been sent before him.'

\s5
\v 29 He who has the bride is the bridegroom. Now the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and listens, rejoices
greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice. This, then, is my joy made complete.
\v 30 He must increase, but I must decrease.

\s5
\p
\v 31 He who comes from above is above all. He who is of the earth is from the earth and speaks of earthly things. He who
comes from heaven is above all.
\v 32 He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no man accepts his testimony.
\v 33 He who has received his testimony has confirmed that God is true.

\s5
\v 34 For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God.  For he does not give the Spirit by measure.
\v 35 The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.
\v 36 He that believes in the Son has everlasting life, but the one who disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God
abides on him."



 

\s5
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Now when Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that he was making and baptizing more disciples than John
\v 2 (although Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples were),
\v 3 he left Judea and departed for Galilee.

\s5
\v 4 Now it was necessary for him to pass through Samaria.
\v 5 Then he came to a town of Samaria, called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.

\s5
\v 6  Jacob’s well was there. Jesus was tired from his journey and sat by the well. It was about noon time.
\v 7 A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, "Give me some water to drink."
\v 8 For his disciples had gone away into the town to buy food.

\s5
\v 9 Then the Samaritan woman said to him, "How is it that you, a Jew, are asking me, a Samaritan woman, for something to drink?" For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.
\v 10 Jesus answered her, "If you had known the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, 'Give me a drink,'
you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water."

\s5
\v 11 The woman replied, "Sir, you do not have a bucket, and the well is deep. Where would you get that living water?
\v 12 You are not greater, are you, than our father Jacob who gave us the well and drank from it himself as did his sons and his cattle?"

\s5
\v 13 Jesus replied, "Everyone who drinks some of this water will be thirsty again, 
\v 14 but whoever drinks some of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again. Instead, the water that I will give him will 
become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life."

\s5
\v 15 The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water so that I may not get thirsty and not have to come here to draw water."
\v 16 Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband, and come back here."

\s5
\v 17 The woman answered, saying to him, "I do not have a husband." Jesus replied, "You have said well, 'I have no husband,'
\v 18 for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband! In this you have spoken well!"

\s5
\v 19 The woman said to him, "Sir, I see that you are a prophet.
\v 20 Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you people say that Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship."

\s5
\v 21 Jesus replied to her, "Woman, believe me, the time is coming when you will
worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.
\v 22 You people worship what you do not know. We worship that which we know, for salvation is from the Jews.

\s5
\v 23 However, the hour is coming, and now is here, when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for 
the Father is seeking such people to be his worshipers.
\v 24 God is a Spirit, and the people who worship him must worship in spirit and truth."

\s5
\v 25 The woman said to him, "I know that the Messiah is coming (the one who is called Christ). When he comes, he will declare everything to us."
\v 26 Jesus said to her, "I, the one speaking to you, am he."

\s5
\p
\v 27 At that very moment his disciples returned.  Now they were wondering why he was speaking with a woman, yet no one said, "What do you want?" or "Why are you speaking with her?"

\s5
\v 28 So the woman left her water pot, went back to the town, and said to the people,
\v 29 "Come, see a man who told me all things that I ever did. This could not be the Christ, could it?"
\v 30 They left the town and came to him.

\s5
\v 31 In the meantime, the disciples were asking him, saying, "Rabbi, eat something."
\v 32 But he said to them, "I have food to eat that you do not know about."
\v 33 The disciples therefore said to each other, "No one has brought him anything to eat, have they?"

\s5
\v 34 Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to complete his work.
\v 35 Do you not say, 'There are yet four months and then the harvest will come'?  I am saying to you, look up
and see the fields, for they are already ripe for harvest!
\v 36 He who is harvesting receives wages and gathers fruit for everlasting life, so that he who sows and he who harvests may
rejoice together.

\s5
\v 37 For in this is the saying true, 'One sows, and another harvests.'
\v 38 I sent you to harvest what you have not worked for. Others have labored, and you yourselves have entered into their labor."

\s5
\p
\v 39 Many of the Samaritans in that city believed in him because of the woman's report, she who had said, "He told me everything
that I have ever done."
\v 40 So when the Samaritans came to him, they implored him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.

\s5
\v 41 And many more believed because of his word.
\v 42 They were saying to the woman, "We believe, not because of your words only, for we have heard for ourselves, and we now know that
this is indeed the Savior of the world."

\s5
\p
\v 43 After those two days, he departed from there for Galilee.
\v 44 For Jesus himself declared that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
\v 45 When he came into Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all the things that he had done in Jerusalem at the
festival, for they also had gone to the festival.

\s5
\p
\v 46 Now he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine.  There was a certain royal official whose son
was sick at Capernaum.
\v 47 When he heard that Jesus had left Judea and returned to Galilee, he went to Jesus and implored
him that he would come down and heal his son who was at the point of death.

\s5
\v 48 Jesus then said to him, "Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will not believe."
\v 49 The official said to him, "Sir, come down before my child dies."
\v 50 Jesus said to him, "Go; your son lives. "The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his
way.

\s5
\v 51 While he was going down, his servants met him, saying that his son was living.
\v 52 So he asked them the time when he began to improve. They replied to him, "Yesterday at the seventh hour the
fever left him."

\s5
\v 53 Then the father realized that it was at that hour that Jesus had said to him, "Your son lives." So he himself and his whole household believed.

\v 54 This was the second sign that Jesus did when he came out of Judea to Galilee.





\s5
\c 5
\p
\v 1 After this there was a festival of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\v 2 Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five roofed porticos.
\v 3-4 A great number of people who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed were lying in these porticos. 
\f + Some early texts have this verse, but others do not. We recommend that you omit this verse: “for an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the waters stepped in was made whole, with whatsoever disease he was holden.” \f*

\s5
\v 5 A certain man was there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.
\v 6 When Jesus saw him lying there, and after he realized that he had been there a long time,
 he said to him, "Do you want to be well?"

\s5
\v 7 The sick man replied, "Sir, I do not have anyone, when the water is stirred up, to put me into the pool. When I am trying, another steps down before me."
\v 8 Jesus said to him, "Get up, take up your mat, and walk."

\s5
\v 9 Immediately the man was healed, took up his bed, and walked.
\p Now that day was a Sabbath.

\s5
\v 10 So the Jewish leaders said to him who was cured, "It is the Sabbath, and you are not permitted to carry your mat."
\v 11 He replied, "He who made me well said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.'"

\s5
\v 12 They asked him, "Who is the man that said to you, 'Pick up
your bed and walk?'"
\v 13 However, the one who was healed did not know who it was because Jesus had withdrawn himself, for there was a crowd in the place.

\s5
\v 14 Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, "See, you have become well! Do not sin any more, lest something worse happens to you."
\v 15 The man went away and reported to the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well.

\s5
\v 16 Now because of these things the Jewish leaders persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the Sabbath.
\v 17 Jesus told them, "My Father is working even now, and I, too, work."
\v 18 Because of this, the Jews sought all the more to kill him because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God
his own Father, making himself equal to God.

\s5
\p
\v 19 Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, the Son can do nothing of himself, except only what
he sees the Father doing, for whatever the Father  is doing, the Son does these things also.
\v 20 For the Father loves the Son, and he is showing him everything that he himself does, and he will show
him greater things than these so that you will be amazed.

\s5
\v 21 For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whomever he wishes.
\v 22 For neither does the Father judge anyone, but he has given all judgment to the Son
\v 23 so that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father. The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.

\s5
\v 24 Truly, truly, he who hears my word and believes him that sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned but has passed out of death into life.

\s5
\v 25 Truly, truly, the time is coming and is here now when the dead will hear the voice of me, the Son of God, and they who hear will live.

\s5
\v 26 For as the Father has life in himself, thus he has given to the Son also to have life in himself,
\v 27 and the Father has given the Son authority to exercise judgment because he is the Son of Man.

\s5
\v 28 Do not be amazed at this, for there is a time coming in which all who are in the tombs will hear his voice
\v 29 and will come out: those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.

\s5
\p
\v 30 I can do nothing from myself.  As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous because I am not seeking my own will but the will of him who sent me.
\v 31 If I should testify about myself alone, my testimony would not be true.
\v 32 There is another who testifies concerning me, and I know that the testimony that he gives about me is true.

\s5
\v 33 You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.
\v 34 However, the testimony that I receive is not from man.  I say these things that you might be saved.
\v 35 John was a lamp that was burning and shining, and you were willing to rejoice for a season in his light.

\s5
\v 36 Yet the testimony that I have is greater than that of John, for the works that the Father has given me to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify concerning me that the Father has sent me.
\v 37 The Father who sent me, he has testified concerning me. You have neither heard his voice nor seen his form at any time. 
\v 38 You do not have his word remaining in you, for you are not believing in the one whom he has sent.

\s5
\v 39 You search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life, and these same scriptures testify concerning
me, 
\v 40 and you are not willing to come to me so that you may have life.

\s5
\v 41 I do not receive praise from men,
\v 42 but I know that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.

\s5
\v 43 I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not receive me.  If another should come in his own name, you would receive him.
\v 44 How can you believe, you who accept praise from one another but are not seeking the praise that
comes from the only God?

\s5
\v 45 Do not think that I myself will accuse you before the Father. There is another one who accuses you, that is Moses on whom you have put your hopes.
\v 46 If you were believing Moses, you would be believing me because he wrote concerning me.
\v 47 If you do not believe his writings, how are you going to believe my words?"





\s5
\c 6
\p
\v 1 After these things, Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, also called the Sea of Tiberias.
\v 2 A great crowd was following him, because they were seeing the signs that he was doing on those who were sick.
\v 3 Jesus went up the mountainside and sat down there with his disciples.

\s5
\v 4 (Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.)
\v 5 When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming to him, he said to Philip, "Where are we going
to buy bread so that these may eat?"
\v 6 (Now Jesus said this to test Philip, for he himself knew what he was going to do.)

\s5
\v 7 Philip answered him, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread would not be sufficient for each one to have even a little."
\v 8 One of the disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to Jesus,
\v 9 "There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these among so many?"

\s5
\v 10 Jesus said, "Make the people sit down." (Now there was much grass in the place.) So the men sat down, about five thousand in number.
\v 11 Then Jesus took the loaves and after giving thanks, he distributed to those that were sitting. He then distributed the fish in the same way, as much as they wanted.
\v 12 When the people were filled, he said to his disciples, "Gather up the broken pieces which remain, so that nothing is wasted."

\s5
\v 13 So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves—the pieces left over from those who had eaten.
\v 14 Then when the people saw this sign that he did, they said, "This truly is the prophet who is to come into the
world."
\v 15 When Jesus realized that they were about to come and seize him by force to make him king, he withdrew again up the
mountain by himself.

\s5
\p
\v 16 When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake.
\v 17 They got into a boat, and were going over the sea to Capernaum. (It was dark by this time, and Jesus had not yet come to them.)
\v 18 By now a strong wind was blowing, and the sea was getting rough.

\s5
\v 19 Then when the disciples had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were afraid.
\v 20 However, he said to them, "It is I! Do not be afraid."
\v 21 Then they were willing to receive him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the land where they were
going.

\p
\v 22 The next day, the crowd that had been standing on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there except the one and
that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples but that his disciples had gone away alone.
\v 23 (However, there were some boats that came from Tiberias close to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.)

\s5
\v 24 When the crowd discovered that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they themselves got into the boats and
went to Capernaum seeking Jesus.
\v 25 After they found him on the other side of the lake, they said to him, "Rabbi, when did you come here?"

\s5
\v 26 Jesus replied to them, saying, "Truly, truly, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate some of
the loaves and were filled.
\v 27 Stop working for the food that perishes, but work for the food that endures to everlasting life which the Son of Man will give you, for God the Father has set his seal on him.

\s5
\v 28 Then they said to him, "What must we do, that we may do the works of God?"
\v 29 Jesus replied, "This is the work of God: that you believe in the one whom he has sent."

\s5
\v 30 So they said to him, "What sign then will you do, that we may see and believe you? What will you do?
\v 31 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written, 'He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.'"

\s5
\v 32 Then Jesus replied to them, "Truly, truly, it was not Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven, 
but it is my Father who is giving you the true bread out of heaven.
\v 33 For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world."
\v 34 So they said to him, "Sir, give us this bread all the time."

\s5
\v 35 Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life, he who comes to me will not hunger, and he who believes on me will 
never thirst.
\v 36 However, I said to you that you have seen me, and you still do not believe.
\v 37 All whom the Father gives me will come to me, and he who comes to me I will absolutely not drive away.

\s5
\v 38 For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.
\v 39 And this is the will of him who sent me, that of all those whom he has given me I should not lose anyone, but should raise
them up on the last day.
\v 40 For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life;
and I will raise him up on the last day.

\s5
\p
\v 41 Then the Jewish leaders grumbled about him because he had said, "I am the bread that has come down out of heaven."
\v 42 They said, "Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does he say, 'I have come down out of heaven'?'"

\s5
\v 43 Jesus replied, saying to them, "Stop grumbling among yourselves.
\v 44 No man can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up on the last day.
\v 45 It is written in the prophets, 'They will all be taught by God.' Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me.

\s5
\v 46 Not that any man has seen the Father, except he who is from God—he has seen the Father.
\v 47 Truly, truly, he who believes has everlasting life.

\s5
\v 48 I am the bread of life.
\v 49 Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.

\s5
\v 50 This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, so that a person may eat some of it and not die.
\v 51 I am the living bread that came down out of heaven. If anyone eats some of this bread, he will live forever. The
bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world."

\s5
\p
\v 52 The Jews became angry among themselves and began to argue, saying, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"
\v 53 Jesus then said to them, "Truly, truly, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his
blood, you will not have life in yourselves.

\s5
\v 54 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
\v 55 For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.
\v 56 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him.

\s5
\v 57 As the living Father sent me, and as I live because of the Father, so he who eats me, he will also live because of me.
\v 58 This is the bread that has come down out of heaven, not as the fathers ate and died. He who eats this bread will live forever."
\v 59 Jesus said these things in the synagogue, while he was teaching in Capernaum.

\s5
\p
\v 60 Then many of his disciples, when they heard this, said, "This is a difficult teaching; who can accept it?"
\v 61 Jesus, because he knew in himself that his disciples were grumbling at this, said to them, "Does this offend you?

\s5
\v 62 Then what if you should see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?
\v 63 It is the Spirit who gives life. The flesh profits nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit, and they are life.

\s5
\v 64 Yet there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus knew from the beginning who the ones were who would not believe and who it was who would betray him.
\v 65 He said, "It is because of this that I said to you that no one can come to me unless it is granted to him by the Father."

\s5
\p
\v 66 After this, many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him.
\v 67 Jesus said then to the twelve, "You do not want to go away also, do you?"
\v 68 Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of everlasting life,
\v 69 and we have believed and come to know that you are the Holy One of God."

\s5
\v 70 Jesus said to them, "Did not I choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?"
\v 71 Now he spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for it was he, being one of the twelve, who would betray Jesus.




\s5
\c 7
\p
\v 1 And after these things Jesus traveled about in Galilee, for he was not willing to go into Judea because the Jews wanted to kill him.
\v 2 Now the festival of the Jews, the Festival of Shelters, was near.

\s5
\v 3 His brothers therefore said to him, "Leave this place and go to Judea, so that your disciples also may see the deeds that
you do.
\v 4 No one does anything in private if he himself wants to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself
to the world."

\s5
\v 5 For even his brothers did not believe in him.
\v 6 Jesus therefore said to them, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.
\v 7 The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it that its deeds are evil.

\s5
\v 8 You go up to the festival; I am not going to this festival because my time has not yet been fulfilled.
\v 9 After he said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee.

\s5
\p
\v 10 However, after his brothers had gone up to the festival, then he also went up, not publicly but in private.
\v 11 The Jews were looking for him at the festival and said, "Where is he?"

\s5
\v 12 There was much discussion among the crowds about him. Some said, "He is a good man." Others said, "No, he leads the crowds astray."
\v 13 Yet no one spoke openly about him for fear of the Jews.

\s5
\p
\v 14 When the festival was half over, Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching.
\v 15 The Jews were marveling and saying, "How does this man know so much? He has never been educated."
\v 16 Jesus answered them and said, "My teaching is not mine, but is of him who sent me.

\s5
\v 17 If anyone wishes to do the will of that person, he will know about this teaching, whether it comes from God, or
whether I speak from myself.
\v 18 Whoever speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but whoever seeks the glory of him who sent him, that person is
true, and there is no unrighteousness in him.

\s5
\v 19 Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you does the law. Why do you want to kill me?"
\v 20 The crowd answered, "You have a demon. Who wants to kill you?"

\s5
\v 21 Jesus answered and said to them, "I did one work, and you all marvel because of it.
\v 22 Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the ancestors), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a man.

\s5
\v 23 If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses is not broken, why are you angry with me because I
made a man completely well on the Sabbath?
\v 24 Do not judge according to appearance, but judge righteously."

\s5
\p
\v 25 Some of them from Jerusalem said, "Is not this he whom they seek to kill?
\v 26 And see, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. It cannot be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ, can it?
\v 27 But we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from."

\s5
\v 28 Jesus was crying out in the temple, teaching and saying, "You both know me and know where I come from; but I have not come of
myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you do not know.
\v 29 I know him because I come from him and he sent me."

\s5
\v 30 They were trying to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him because his hour had not yet come.
\v 31 However, many in the crowds believed in him. They said, "When the Christ comes, will he do more signs than what this man has done?"
\v 32 The Pharisees heard the crowds whispering these things about Jesus, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent
officers to arrest him.

\s5
\v 33 Jesus then said, "Yet a little while am I still with you, and then I go to him who sent me.
\v 34 You will seek me but will not find me; where I go, you will not be able to come."

\s5
\v 35 The Jews therefore said among themselves, "Where will this man go that we will not be able to find him? Will he go to the
Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?
\v 36 What is this word that he said, 'You will seek me but will not find me; where I go, you will not be able to come'?"

\s5
\p
\v 37 Now on the last day, the great day of the festival, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come
to me and drink.
\v 38 He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water."

\s5
\v 39 But he said this about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him would receive; the Spirit had not yet been given because Jesus was not yet glorified.

\s5
\v 40 Some of the crowd, when they heard these words, said, "This is indeed the prophet."
\v 41 Others said, "This is the Christ." But some said, "What, does the Christ come from Galilee?
\v 42 Have not the Scriptures said that the Christ will come from the line of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?"

\s5
\v 43 So there arose a division in the crowds because of him.
\v 44 Some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him.

\s5
\p
\v 45 Then the officers came back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, "Why did you not bring him?"
\v 46 The officers answered, "No man has ever spoken like this before."

\s5
\v 47 The Pharisees therefore answered them, "Have you also been led astray?
\v 48 Have any of the rulers believed in him, or any of the Pharisees?
\v 49 But this crowd that does not know the law are cursed."

\s5
\v 50 Nicodemus said to them (he who came to Jesus before, being one of the Pharisees),
\v 51 "Does our law judge a man unless it first hears from him and knows what he does?"
\v 52 They answered and said to him, "Are you also from Galilee? Search and see that no prophet comes from Galilee."

\v 53 [Then every man went to his own house.

\nb
\v 1 Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
\v 2 Early in the morning he came again to the temple, and all the people came to him; he sat down and taught them.
\v 3 The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman caught in the act of adultery; they placed her in their midst.

\s5
\v 4 Then they said to Jesus, "Teacher, this woman has been caught in adultery, in the very act.
\v 5 Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such persons; what do you say about her?"
\v 6 They said this in order to trap him so that they might have something to accuse him about, but Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with his finger.

\s5
\v 7 When they continued asking him, he stood up and said to them, "He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her."
\v 8 Again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger.

\s5
\v 9 When they heard it, they went out one by one, beginning with the oldest. Finally Jesus was left alone, with the woman who had been in their midst.
\v 10 Jesus stood up and said to her, "Woman, where are your accusers? Did no one condemn you?"
\v 11 She said, "No one, Lord." Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you. Go your way; from now on sin no more."]
\f + \ft The best earliest manuscripts do not have John 7:35-8:11 \f*

\s5
\p
\v 12 Again Jesus spoke to the people saying, "I am the light of the world; he who follows me will not walk in the darkness but will have the light of life."
\v 13 The Pharisees said to him, "You bear witness about yourself; your witness is not true."

\s5
\v 14 Jesus answered and said to them, "Even if I bear witness about myself, my witness is true. I know from where I came and where I am going, but you do not know from where I came or where I am going.
\v 15 You judge after the flesh; I judge no one.
\v 16 Yet if I judge, my judgment is true because I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me.

\s5
\v 17 Yes, and in your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true.
\v 18 I am he who bears witness about myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness about me."

\s5
\v 19 They said to him, "Where is your father?" Jesus answered, "You know neither me nor my Father; if you knew me, you
would know my Father also."
\v 20 He said these words near the treasury as he taught in the temple, and no one arrested him because his hour had not yet come.

\s5
\p
\v 21 He said again to them, "I am going away; you will seek me and will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot
come."
\v 22 The Jews said, "Will he kill himself, he who said, 'Where I am going, you cannot come'?"

\s5
\v 23 Jesus said to them, "You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.
\v 24 Therefore, I said to you that you will die in your sins. For unless you believe that I AM, you will die in your sins."

\s5
\v 25 They said therefore to him, "Who are you?" Jesus said to them, "What I have said to you from the
beginning.
\v 26 I have many things to speak and to judge about you. However, he who sent me is true; and the things that I heard
from him, these things I say to the world."
\v 27 They did not understand that he was speaking to them about the Father.

\s5
\v 28 Jesus said, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then will you know that I AM, and that I do nothing of myself.
As the Father taught me, I speak these things.
\v 29 He who sent me is with me, and he has not left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to him."
\v 30 As Jesus was saying these things, many believed in him.

\s5
\p
\v 31 Jesus said to those Jews that had believed him, "If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples;
\v 32 and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."
\v 33 They answered him, "We are Abraham’s descendants and have never yet been in bondage to anyone; how can you say, 'You will be made free'?"

\s5
\v 34 Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin.
\v 35 The slave does not remain in the house permanently; the son remains permanently.
\v 36 Therefore, if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.

\s5
\v 37 I know that you are Abraham’s descendants; you seek to kill me because my word has no place in you.
\v 38 I say the things that I have seen with my Father, and you also do the things that you heard from
your father."

\s5
\v 39 They answered and said to him, "Our father is Abraham." Jesus said to them, "If you were Abraham’s children, you would do
the works of Abraham.
\v 40 Yet, now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.
\v 41 You do the works of your father." They said to him, "We were not born in fornication; we have one Father, God."

\s5
\v 42 Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I proceeded and have come from God; for neither have
I come of myself, but he sent me.
\v 43 Why do you not understand my words? It is because you cannot bear to hear my words.
\v 44 You are of your father, the devil, and you wish to do the lusts of your father. He was a murderer from the
beginning and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature because he is a liar and the father of lies.

\s5
\v 45 Yet, because I speak the truth, you do not believe me.
\v 46 Which one of you convicts me of sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe me?
\v 47 He who is of God hears the words of God; you do not hear them because you are not of God."

\s5
\v 48 The Jews answered and said to him, "Say we not truly that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?"
\v 49 Jesus answered, "I do not have a demon; but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.

\s5
\v 50 I do not seek my own glory; there is one who seeks and judges.
\v 51 Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death."

\s5
\v 52 The Jews said to him, "Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham and the prophets died; but you say, 'If anyone
keeps my word, he will never taste death.'
\v 53 You are not greater than our father Abraham who died, are you? The prophets also died. Who do you make yourself out to be?"

\s5
\v 54 Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing; it is my Father who glorifies me—about whom you say that he is
your God.
\v 55 You have not known him, but I know him. If I should say, 'I do not know him,' I would be like you, a liar. However, I
know him and keep his word.
\v 56 Your father Abraham rejoiced at seeing my day; he saw it and was glad."

\s5
\v 57 The Jews said to him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?"
\v 58 Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I AM."
\v 59 Then they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.



\s5
\c 9
\p
\v 1 Now as Jesus passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.
\v 2 His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind?"

\s5
\v 3 Jesus answered, "Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but that the works of God should be revealed in him.
\v 4 We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day.  Night is coming when no one will be able to work.
\v 5 While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."

\s5
\v 6 After Jesus said these things, he spit on the ground, made mud with the saliva, and anointed the man's eyes with the mud.
\v 7 He said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is translated 'sent')."  So the man went away, washed, and came back, seeing.

\s5
\v 8 Then the man's neighbors and those who had seen him previously as a beggar were saying, "Is not this the man that used to sit and beg?"
\v 9 Some said, "It is he."  Others said, "No, but he is like him."  But he was saying , "I am the one."


\s5
\v 10 They said to him, "Then how were your eyes opened?"
\v 11 He answered, "The man who is called Jesus made mud and anointed my eyes and said to me, 'Go to Siloam and wash.' So I went and washed, and I regained my sight."
\v 12 They said to him, "Where is he?" He replied, "I do not know."

\s5
\p
\v 13 They brought the man who used to be blind to the Pharisees.
\v 14 Now it was the Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.
\v 15 Then again the Pharisees asked him how he had received his sight. He said to them, "He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I now can see."

\s5
\v 16 Some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God because he does not keep the Sabbath." Others said, "How could a man that is a sinner do such signs?" So there was a division among them.
\v 17 So they asked the blind man again, "What do you say about him because he opened your eyes?" The blind man said, "He is a prophet."
\v 18 Now the Jews still did not believe concerning him who had been blind and had received his sight until they called
the parents of him that had received his sight.

\s5
\v 19 They asked the parents, "Is this your son whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"
\v 20 So his parents answered them, "We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.
\v 21 How he now sees, we do not know, and who opened his eyes, we do not know.  Ask him. He is an adult. He can speak for himself."
\s5
\v 22 His parents said these things, because they were afraid  of the Jews. For the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess Jesus to be the Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
\v 23 Because of this, his parents said, "He is an adult. Ask him."

\s5
\v 24 So for a second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, "Give glory to God.  We know that this man is a sinner."
\v 25 Then that man replied, "Whether he is a sinner, I do not know. One thing I do know: Once I was blind, and now I see."

\s5
\v 26 Then they said to him, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"
\v 27 He answered, "I have told you already, and you would not listen!  Why do you want to hear it again? You do not want to become his disciples too, do you?

\s5
\v 28 They reviled him and said, "You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.
\v 29 We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know from where he comes."

\s5
\v 30 The man answered and said to them, "Why, this is a remarkable thing, that you do not know where he is from, and yet he opened my eyes.
\v 31 We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if any man is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens to him.

\s5
\v 32 Since the world began it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.
\v 33 If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."
\v 34 They answered and said to him, "You were altogether born in sins, and you are now teaching us?"  Then they cast him out of the synagogue.

\s5
\p
\v 35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out of the synagogue. He found him and said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"
\v 36 He replied and said, "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?"
\v 37 Jesus said to him, "You have seen him, and the one who is speaking with you is he."
\v 38 The man said, "Lord, I believe."  Then he worshiped him.

\s5
\v 39 Jesus said, "For judgment I came into this world so that those who do not see may see and so that those who see may become blind."
\v 40 Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things and asked him, "Are we also blind?"
\v 41 Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin. However, now you say, 'We see,' so your sin remains.




\s5
\c 10
\p
\v 1 "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter by the gate into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, that man is a thief and a robber.
\v 2 He who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.

\s5
\v 3 To him the gatekeeper opens. The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name 
and leads them out.
\v 4 When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.

\s5
\v 5 They will not follow a stranger but will instead avoid him, for they do not know the voice of strangers."
\v 6 Jesus spoke this parable to them, but they did not understand what these things were that he was saying to them.

\s5
\p
\v 7 Then Jesus said to them again, "Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.
\v 8 All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.

\s5
\v 9 I am the gate. If anyone enters in through me, he will be saved; he will go in and out and will find pasture.
\v 10 The thief does not come except to steal, kill, and destroy. I have come so that they might have life and have it more abundantly.

\s5
\v 11 I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
\v 12 He who is a hired servant, and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and escapes. And the wolf carries them off and scatters them.
\v 13 He runs away because he is a hired servant and does not care for the sheep.

\s5
\v 14 I am the good shepherd, and I know my own, and my own know me.
\v 15 The Father knows me, and I know the Father, and I lay down my life for the sheep.
\v 16 I have other sheep that are not of this fold.  Those, also, I must bring, and they will hear my voice so that there will be one flock and one shepherd.

\s5
\v 17 This is why the Father loves me: I lay down my life that I may take it again.
\v 18 No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it
again. I have received this command from my Father."

\s5
\p
\v 19 A division again occurred among the Jews because of these words.
\v 20 Many of them said, "He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to him?"
\v 21 Others said, "These are not the statements of one possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"

\s5
\p
\v 22 Then came the Festival of the Dedication in Jerusalem.
\v 23 It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon’s porch.
\v 24 Then the Jews surrounded him and said to him, "How long will you hold us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly."

\s5
\v 25 Jesus replied to them, "I told you, but you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father’s name, these testify concerning me.
\v 26 Yet you do not believe because you are not my sheep.

\s5
\v 27 My sheep hear my voice; I know them, and they follow me.
\v 28 I give to them eternal life; they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.

\s5
\v 29 My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all others, and no one is able to snatch
them out of the Father’s hand.
\v 30 I and the Father are one."
\v 31 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.

\s5
\v 32 Jesus answered them, "I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of those works are you stoning me?"
\v 33 The Jews answered him, "We are not stoning you for any good work, but for blasphemy, because you, a man, are making yourself God."

\s5
\v 34 Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your Law, 'I said, "You are gods'"?
\v 35 If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken),
\v 36 do you say about him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am
the Son of God'?

\s5
\v 37 If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not believe me.
\v 38 However, if I am doing them, even if you do not believe me, believe in the works so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and that I am in the Father."
\v 39 They tried again to seize Jesus, but he went away out of their hand.

\s5
\p
\v 40 Jesus went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing at first, and he stayed there.
\v 41 Many people came to Jesus.  They kept saying, "John indeed did no signs, but all the things that John has said about this man are true."
\v 42 Many people believed in Jesus there.




\s5
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Now a certain man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
\v 2 It was the same Mary who would anoint the Lord with myrrh and wipe his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.

\s5
\v 3 The sisters then sent word to Jesus and said, "Lord, see, he whom you love is sick."
\v 4 When Jesus heard it, he said, "This sickness is not to end in death, but it is instead for the glory of God so that the Son of God may be glorified by it."

\s5
\v 5 Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
\v 6 When he heard that Lazarus was sick, Jesus stayed two more days in the place where he was.
\v 7 Then after this, he said to the disciples, "Let us go to Judea again."

\s5
\v 8 The disciples said to him, "Rabbi, the Jews were only now trying to stone you, and are you going back there again?"
\v 9 Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours of light in a day? If someone walks in the daytime, he will not stumble, because he sees by the daylight.

\s5
\v 10 However, if he walks at night, he will stumble because the light is not in him."
\v 11 Jesus said these things, and after these things, he said to them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awake
him out of sleep."

\s5
\v 12 The disciples therefore said to him, "Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover."
\v 13 Now Jesus had spoken of Lazarus' death, but they thought that he was speaking of taking rest in sleep.
\v 14 Then Jesus said to them plainly, "Lazarus is dead.

\s5
\v 15 I am glad, for your sakes, that I was not there so that you may believe. Let us go to him."
\v 16 Thomas, who was called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, "Let us also go so that we may die with Jesus."

\s5
\p
\v 17 When Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days.
\v 18 Now Bethany was near to Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away.
\v 19 Many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them about their brother.
\v 20 Then Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him, but Mary still sat in the house.

\s5
\v 21 Martha then said to Jesus, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.
\v 22 Even now, I know that whatever you ask from God, he will give to you."
\v 23 Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."

\s5
\v 24 Martha said to him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."
\v 25 Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in me, though he die, yet he will live;
\v 26 and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?"

\s5
\v 27 She said to him, "Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, the one who is coming into the world."
\v 28 When she had said this, she went away and called Mary her sister in private. She said, "The Teacher is here and is calling for you."
\v 29 When Mary heard this, she arose quickly and went to Jesus.

\s5
\v 30 Now Jesus had not yet come into the village but was still in the place where Martha had met him.
\v 31 Then the Jews who were with Mary in the house and who were consoling her, when they saw her quickly rise and go out, followed her; they supposed that she was going to the tomb to weep there.
\v 32 Mary then, when she came where Jesus was and saw him, fell down at his feet and said to him, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."

\s5
\v 33 When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he groaned in the spirit
and was troubled;
\v 34 he said, "Where have you laid him?" They said to him, "Lord, come and see."
\v 35 Jesus wept.

\s5
\v 36 Then the Jews said, "See how much he loved Lazarus!"
\v 37 But some of them said, "Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the one who was blind, have also made this man not die?"
\s5
\v 38 Then Jesus, while groaning again in himself, went to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.
\v 39 Jesus said, "Take away the stone." Martha, the sister of Lazarus, the one who had died, said to Jesus, "Lord, by this time the body
will be decaying, for he has been dead four days."
\v 40 Jesus said to her, "Did I not say to you that, if you believed, you would see the glory of God?"

\s5
\v 41 So they took away the stone. Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, "Father, I thank you that you listened to me.
\v 42 I knew that you always listen to me, but it is because of the crowd that is standing around me that I said this, so that they may believe that you have sent me."

\s5
\v 43 After he had said this, he cried out with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"
\v 44 The dead man came out, bound hand and foot with burial cloths, and his face was bound about with a cloth. Jesus
said to them, "Untie him and let him go."

\s5
\p
\v 45 Then many of the Jews who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed in him;
\v 46 but some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them the things that Jesus had done.

\s5
\p
\v 47 Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the council together and said, "What will we do? This man does many signs.
\v 48 If we leave him alone like this, all will believe in him; the Romans will come and take away both our place and our
nation."

\s5
\v 49 However, a certain man among them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, "You know nothing at all.
\v 50 You do not take into account that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people rather than that the whole nation should perish."

\s5
\v 51 Now this he said not of his own accord; instead, being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;
\v 52 and not for the nation only, but that Jesus might also gather together into one the children of God that are scattered in various places.
\v 53 So from that day onward they planned how to put Jesus to death.

\s5
\p
\v 54 No longer did Jesus walk openly among the Jews, but he departed from there into the country near to the wilderness into a
town called Ephraim. There he stayed with the disciples.
\v 55 Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover in order to purify
themselves.

\s5
\v 56 They were looking for Jesus, and speaking one with another as they stood in the temple, "What do you think? That he will not
come to the festival?"
\v 57 Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given an order that if anyone knew where Jesus was, he should report it so 
that they might seize him.



\s5
\c 12
\p
\v 1 Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom he had raised from the dead.
\v 2 So they made him a supper there, and Martha was serving, while Lazarus was one of those who sat at table with Jesus.
\v 3 Then Mary took a litra of perfume made of pure nard, very precious, anointed the feet of Jesus with it, and wiped his feet
with her hair;  the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.

\s5
\v 4 Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, the one who would betray Jesus, said,
\v 5 "Why was not this perfume sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?"
\v 6 Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief: he had charge of the moneybag and would take some of what was in it for himself.

\s5
\v 7 Jesus said, "Allow her to keep what she has for the day of my burial.
\v 8 The poor you will always have with you; but you will not always have me."

\s5
\p
\v 9 Now a large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was there, and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but so that they
might also see Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.
\v 10 The chief priests conspired together so that they might also put Lazarus to death;
\v 11 for it was because of him that many of the Jews went away and believed on Jesus.

\s5
\p
\v 12 On the next day a great crowd came to the festival. When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
\v 13 they took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet him and cried out, "Hosanna! Blessed
is he who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel."

\s5
\v 14 Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it; as it was written,
\v 15 "Do not fear, daughter of Zion; see, your King is coming, sitting on the young of a donkey."

\s5
\v 16 His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, they remembered that these
things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him.

\s5
\v 17 Now the crowd that had been with Jesus when he had called Lazarus out of the tomb and had raised him from the dead, bore witness to others.
\v 18 It was also for this reason that the crowd went out to meet him because they heard that he had done this sign. 
\v 19 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, "Look, you can do nothing; see, the world has gone after him."

\s5
\p
\v 20 Now certain Greeks were among those who were going up to worship at the festival.
\v 21 These went to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, saying, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus."
\v 22 Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew went with Philip, and they told Jesus.

\s5
\v 23 Jesus answered them and said, "The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified.
\v 24 Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone; but if it dies, it will bear much fruit.

\s5
\v 25 He who loves his life will lose it; but he who hates his life in this world will keep it for everlasting life.
\v 26 If anyone serves me, let him follow me; and where I am, there will my servant be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.

\s5
\v 27 My soul is troubled now: what should I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? But for this reason I came to this hour.
\v 28 Father, glorify your name." Then a voice came out of heaven and said, "I have both glorified it and will glorify it again."
\v 29 Then the crowd that stood by and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, "An angel has spoken to him."

\s5
\v 30 Jesus answered and said, "This voice has not come for my sake, but for your sakes.
\v 31 Now is the judgment of this world: Now will the prince of this world be driven out.

\s5
\v 32 And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself."
\v 33 He said this to signify by what manner of death he would die.

\s5
\v 34 The crowd answered him, "We have heard from the Law that the Christ will forever. How can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man?"
\v 35 Jesus then said to them, "Yet a little while longer is the light among you. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness
does not overtake you. He who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.
\v 36 While you have the light, believe in the light so that you may become sons of light."
\p Jesus said these things and then departed and hid from them.

\s5
\v 37 Although Jesus had done so many signs in front of them, yet they did not believe in him
\v 38 so that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he said:
\q "Lord, who has believed our report?
\q And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"
\m

\s5
\v 39 For this reason they could not believe, for Isaiah said again,
\q
\v 40 "He has blinded their eyes, and he has hardened their hearts;
\q otherwise they would see with their eyes and would perceive with their hearts,
\q and would turn,
\q and I would heal them."
\m

\s5
\v 41 Isaiah said these things because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke of him.
\v 42 Nevertheless, even many of the rulers believed in Jesus; but because of the Pharisees, they did not admit it so that they would not be banned from the synagogue.
\v 43 They loved the praise that comes from people more than the praise that comes from God.

\s5
\p
\v 44 Jesus cried out and said, "The one who believes in me, believes not only in me but also in him who sent me,
\v 45 and the one who sees me sees him who sent me.

\s5
\v 46 I have come as a light into the world so that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness.
\v 47 If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I have come, not to judge the world, but to save the
world.

\s5
\v 48 The one who rejects me and who does not receive my words has one who judges him: it is the word that I have spoken which will judge him on the last day.
\v 49 For I did not speak of my own accord. Instead, it is the Father who sent me, who has given me the command about what I should say and what I should speak.
\v 50 I know that his command is life everlasting; so that thing that I say—just as the Father has said them to me, so I say to them."





\s5
\c 13
\p
\v 1 Now before the Festival of the Passover, because Jesus knew that his hour had come that he should go out of this world to
the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.
\v 2 Now the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s
son, to betray Jesus.

\s5
\v 3 Jesus knew that the Father had given all things over into his hands and that he had come from God and was going back to God.
\v 4 He rose from supper and laid down his outer clothing. Then he took a towel and wrapped it around himself.
\v 5 Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that he had put around himself.

\s5
\v 6 He came to Simon Peter, and Peter said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"
\v 7 Jesus answered and said to him, "What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will understand it later."
\v 8 Peter said to him, "You will never wash my feet." Jesus answered him, "If I do not wash you, you can have no part with me."
\v 9 Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, do not wash my feet only, but also my hands and my head."

\s5
\v 10 Jesus said to him, "Anyone who has bathed does not need to wash anything but his feet, and he is entirely clean; you are clean, but not all of you."
\v 11 For Jesus knew who would betray him; that is why he said, "Not all of you are clean."

\s5
\p
\v 12 When Jesus had washed their feet and taken his garments and had sat down again, he said to them, "Do you know what I have done
for you?
\v 13 You call me 'teacher' and 'Lord,' and you say right, for so I am.
\v 14 If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.
\v 15 For I have given you an example so that you also should do as I have done for you.

\s5
\v 16 Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; neither is the one who has been sent greater than the one who sent him.
\v 17 If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.
\v 18 I am not speaking about all of you, for I know those whom I have chosen—but I say this so that the scripture may be fulfilled: 'He who eats my bread lifted up his heel against me.'

\s5
\v 19 I tell you this now before it happens so that when it happens, you may believe that I AM.
\v 20 Truly, truly, I say to you, he who receives me receives whomever I send, and he who receives me receives the one who sent me."

\s5
\p
\v 21 When Jesus said this, he was troubled in the spirit, he testified and said, "Truly, truly, I say to you that one of you will betray me."
\v 22 The disciples looked at each other, wondering of whom he was speaking.

\s5
\v 23 There was at the table reclining against Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, the one whom Jesus loved.
\v 24 Simon Peter therefore motioned to this disciple and said, "Tell
us who it is of whom he is speaking."
\v 25 That disciple leaned back against Jesus’ breast and said to him, "Lord, who is it?"

\s5
\v 26 Then Jesus answered, "He it is for whom I will dip the piece of bread and give it him." So when he had dipped the bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.
\v 27 And after the bread, then Satan entered into him. Jesus then said to him, "What you are about to do, do it quickly."

\s5
\v 28 Now no one at the table knew the reason that Jesus said this to him.
\v 29 Some thought that, because Judas had charge of the money bag, Jesus said to him, "Buy the things we need for the festival," or that he should give something to the poor.
\v 30 After Judas received the bread, he went out immediately; and it was night.

\s5
\p
\v 31 When Judas was gone, Jesus said, "Now the Son of man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.
\v 32 God will glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him immediately.
\v 33 Little children, I am with you for still a little while. You will look for me, and as I said to the Jews, 'Where I am going, you cannot come.' Now I say this to you, also.

\s5
\v 34 I am giving you a new commandment, that you should love one another; as I have loved you, so also you should love one another.
\v 35 By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love one for another."

\s5
\p
\v 36 Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, where are you going?" Jesus answered, "Where I am going, you are not now able to follow, but you will follow afterwards."
\v 37 Peter said to him, "Lord, why cannot I follow you even now? I will lay down my life for you."
\v 38 Jesus answered, "Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster will not crow before you have denied me three times."



\s5
\c 14
\p
\v 1 "Do not let your heart be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me.
\v 2 In my Father’s house are many dwelling places; if it were not so, I would have told you, for I am going to prepare a place for you.
\v 3 If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to myself so that where I am you also may be,

\s5
\v 4 You know the way to where I am going."
\v 5 Thomas said to Jesus, "Lord, we do not know where you are going; how can we know the way?"
\v 6 Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except by me.
\v 7 If you had known me, you would have known my Father also; from now on you do know him and have seen him."

\s5
\v 8 Philip said to Jesus, "Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us."
\v 9 Jesus said to him, "Have I been so long with you, and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen
the Father; how can you say, 'Show us the Father'?

\s5
\v 10 Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me? The words that I am speaking to you I speak not of my own accord; instead, it is the Father living in me who is doing his work.
\v 11 Believe me, that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me; or else believe me because of my very works.

\s5
\v 12 Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes on me, the works that I do, he will do these works also; and he will do even greater works because I am going to the Father.
\v 13 Whatever you ask in my name, I will do it so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
\v 14 If you ask anything in my name, that will I do.

\s5
\v 15 If you love me, you will keep my commandments.
\v 16 And I will pray the Father, and he will give you another Comforter so that he may be with you forever,
\v 17 the Spirit of truth. The world cannot receive him because it does not see him or know him. You, however, know him, for he stays with you and will be in you.

\s5
\v 18 I will not leave you alone; I will come back to you.
\v 19 In just a little while, the world will no more see me, but you see me. Because I live, you also will live.
\v 20 On that day you will know that I am in my Father, and that you are in me, and that I am in you.

\s5
\v 21 Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves me; and he who loves me will be loved by my
Father, and I will love him and will show myself to him."
\v 22 Judas (not Iscariot) said to Jesus, "Lord, what is happening that you will show yourself to us and not to the
world?"

\s5
\v 23 Jesus answered and said to him, "If anyone loves me, he will keep my word. My Father will love him, and we will come
to him and will make our dwelling place with him.
\v 24 Anyone who does not love me does not keep my words. The word that you hear is not mine but the Father’s who sent me.

\s5
\p
\v 25 I have said these things to you, while I am still living among you.
\v 26 However, the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name,  will teach you all things and  will bring to your remembrance all that I said to you.
\v 27 Peace I leave with you; I give my peace to you. I do not give it as the world gives. Do not let your heart be troubled, and do not let it be fearful.

\s5
\v 28 You heard how I said to you, 'I am going away, and I will come back to you.' If you loved me, you would have rejoiced because I am going to the
Father, for the Father is greater than I.
\v 29 Now I have told you before it happens so that, when it does happen, you may believe.

\s5
\v 30 I will not speak much more with you, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no power over me,
\v 31 but so that the world may know that I love the Father, I do what the Father commands me, just as he gave me the commandment. Arise, let us leave this place."





\c 15
\p
\v 1 "I am the true vine, and my Father is the vine grower.
\v 2 He takes away every branch in me that bears no fruit, and he cleans every
branch that bears fruit so that it may bear more fruit.
 
\s5
\v 3 Already you are clean because of the message that I have spoken to you.
\v 4 Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me.
 
\s5
\v 5 I am the vine; you are the branches. He who remains in me and I in him, this same person bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.
\v 6 If anyone does not remain in me, he is thrown away like a branch and dries up; people gather the branches and throw them into the fire, and they are burned up.
\v 7 If you remain in me, and if my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.
 
\s5
\v 8 In this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and that you be my disciples.
\v 9 As the Father has loved me, I also have loved you; remain in my love.
 
\s5
\v 10 If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love as I have kept my Father’s commandments and remain in his love.
\v 11 I have spoken these things to you so that my joy may be in you and so that your joy may be made full.
 
\s5
\v 12 This is my commandment, that you should love one another as I have loved you.
\v 13 No one has love greater than this, that he should lay down his life for his friends.
 
\s5
\v 14 You are my friends if you do the things that I command you.
\v 15 No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing. I have called you friends, for I have made known to you all the things that I heard from my Father.
 
\s5
\v 16 You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you for you to go and bear fruit, and for your fruit to remain. This is so that whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you.
\v 17 These things I command you, that you may love one another.
 
\s5
\v 18 If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before
it hated you.
\v 19 If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world and because I chose you out of the world, for this reason the world hates you.
 
\s5
\v 20 Remember the word that I said to you, ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they kept my word, they would keep yours also.
\v 21 They will do all these things to you for my name’s sake because they do not know him who sent me.
\v 22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
 
\s5
\v 23 He who hates me hates my Father also.
\v 24 If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not have had sin; but now they have both seen and hated me and my Father.
\v 25 This is happening so that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their law: ‘They hated me without a
cause.’
 
\s5
\v 26 When the Comforter has come, whom I will send to you from the Father,
that is, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me.
\v 27 You also are bearing witness because you have been with me from the beginning.



\s5
\c 16
\p
\v 1 "I have spoken these things to you so that you should not be made to stumble.
\v 2 They will put you out of the synagogues; indeed, the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think that he is doing good work for God.
 
\s5
\v 3 They will do these things because they have not known the Father or me.
\v 4 I have spoken these things to you so that when the hour comes for them to happen, you may remember them and how I told you about them. I did not tell you about these things in the beginning because I was with you.
 
\s5
\v 5 However, now I go to him who sent me; yet none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’
\v 6 Because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.
\v 7 Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is better for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not
come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.
 
\s5
\v 8 When he comes, the Comforter will convict the world regarding sin, regarding righteousness, and regarding judgment—
\v 9 regarding sin, because they do not believe in me;
\v 10 regarding righteousness, because I am going to the Father, and you will see me no more;
\v 11 and regarding judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged.
 
\s5
\v 12 I have many things to say to you, but you would not understand them now.
\v 13 However, when he, the Spirit of Truth, has come, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak from
himself; but whatever things he hears, he will say those things; and he will declare to you the things that
are to come.
\v 14 He will glorify me, for he will take things of mine and will declare
them to you.
 
\s5
\v 15 All things whatsoever the Father has are mine; therefore, I said that the Spirit will take things of mine and will declare them to you.
\v 16 In a little while, you will see me no more; after a little while again, you will see me.”
 
\s5
\v 17 Some of his disciples then said one to another, "What is this that he says to us, "A little while, and
you will see me no more,' and again, 'A little while again, and you will see me,' and, 'Because I go to the Father'?"
\v 18 They said therefore, “What is this that he says, 'A little while’? We do not know what he is saying.”
 
\s5
\v 19 Jesus saw that they were eager to ask him, and he said to them, “Do you ask yourselves concerning
this, that I said, ‘In a little while, you will see me no more; after a little while again, you will see me’?
\v 20 Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but
your sorrow will be turned into joy.
\v 21 A woman has sorrow when she has labor pains because her time for delivery has come; but when she has delivered the child, she no longer remembers her pain because of her joy that a baby has been born into the world.
 
\s5
\v 22 Also you, you have sorrow now, but I will see you again; and your heart will rejoice, and no one will be able to take away your joy from you.
\v 23 On that day you will ask me no questions. Truly, truly, I say to you, if you ask anything of the Father, he will give it to you in my name.
\v 24 Until now you have asked nothing in my name; ask, and you will receive so that your joy may be made full.
 
\s5
\p
\v 25 I have spoken these things to you in obscure language, but the hour is coming when I will no more speak to you in obscure language but will instead tell you plainly about the Father.
 
\s5
\v 26 On that day you will ask in my name, and I do not say to you that I will pray to the Father for you;
\v 27 for the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and because you have believed that I came from the Father.
\v 28 I came from the Father, and I have come into the world; once again, I am leaving the world and am going to the Father.”
 
\s5
\v 29 His disciples said, “See, now you are speaking plainly; you are talking in no obscure language.
\v 30 Now know we that you know all things, and that you do not need that anyone should ask you questions. Because of this, we believe that you have come from God.
\v 31 Jesus answered them, “Do you now believe?”
 
\s5
\v 32 See, the hour is coming, yes, and has indeed come, when you will be scattered, everyone to his own possessions, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone because the Father is with me.
\v 33 I have spoken these things to you so that in me you may have peace. In the world you have troubles, but be encouraged: I have overcome the world.”



\s5
\c 17
\p
\v 1 Jesus said these things; then he lifted his eyes up to the heavens and said, “Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you—
\v 2 just as you gave him authority over all flesh so that he should give everlasting life to all whom you have given him.
 
\s5
\v 3 This is everlasting life: that they should know you, the only true God, and him whom you have sent,
Jesus Christ.
\v 4 I glorified you on the earth, having accomplished the work that you have given me to do.
\v 5 Now, Father, glorify me along with your own self with the glory that I had with you before the world was created.
 
\s5
\v 6 I revealed your name to the people whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours; and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word.
\v 7 Now they know that whatever things you have given to me come from you,
\v 8 for the words that you gave me—I have given these words to them. They received them and truly knew that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me.
 
\s5
\v 9 I pray for them. I do not pray for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.
\v 10 All things that are mine are yours, and your things are mine; I am glorified in them.
\v 11 I am no longer in the world, but these people are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name that you have given me so that they may be one, just as we are one.
 
\s5
\v 12 While I was with them, I kept them in your name that you have given me; I guarded them, and not one of them has perished, except the son of perdition, so that the scriptures might be fulfilled.
\v 13 Now I am coming to you; but I am speaking these things in the world so that they may have my joy made full in themselves.
\v 14 I have given them your word; the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.
 
\s5
\v 15 I do not pray that you should take them from the world but that you should keep them from the evil
one.
\v 16 They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.
\v 17 Consecrate them in the truth; your word is truth.
 
\s5
\v 18 You sent me into the world, and I have sent them into the world.
\v 19 For their sakes I consecrate myself so that they themselves also may be consecrated in truth.
 
\s5
\v 20 I pray not only for these, but also for those who will believe in me through their word
\v 21 so that they may all be one, even as you, Father, are in me, and I am in you. I pray that they also may be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.
 
\s5
\v 22 The glory that you have given me—I have given it to them, so that they may be one, just as we
are one—
\v 23 I in them, and you in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that you did send me, and
loved them, even as you loved me.
 
\s5
\v 24 Father, that which you have given to me—I desire that they also may be with me where I am so that they may see my glory, which you
have given to me: for you have loved me since before the foundation of the world.
 
\s5
\v 25 Righteous Father, the world did not know you, but I know you; and these know that you sent me.
\v 26 I made known your name to them, and I will make it known so that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I may be in them.”




\s5
\c 18
\p
\v 1 After Jesus spoke these words, he went out with his disciples over the Kidron Valley, where there was a garden into which he entered, he and his disciples.
\v 2 Now Judas, who was going to betray him, also knew the place, for Jesus often went there with his disciples.
\v 3 Then Judas, having received the group of soldiers and the officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came
there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
 
\s5
\v 4 Then Jesus, who knew all the things that were happening to him, went forward and asked them, “For whom are you looking?”
\v 5 They answered him, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Jesus said to them, “I am.” Judas, who betrayed him, was also standing with the soldiers.
 
\s5
\v 6 So when he said to them, “I am,” they went backward and fell to the ground.
\v 7 Then again he asked them, “For whom are you looking?” Again they said, “Jesus of Nazareth.”
 
\s5
\v 8 Jesus answered, “I told you that I am he; so if you are looking for me, let these others go.”
\v 9 This was so that the word might be fulfilled that he said: “Of those whom you have given me, I lost not one.”
 
\s5
\v 10 Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant and cut off his right ear. Now the servant’s name was Malchus.
\v 11 Jesus said to Peter, “Put the sword back into its sheath. The cup that the Father has given me, should I not drink it?”
 
\s5
\p
\v 12 So the group of soldiers and the captain, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him.
\v 13 They led him first to Annas, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.
\v 14 Now Caiaphas was the one who had given the advice to the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
 
\s5
\p
\v 15 Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and
he entered with Jesus into the court of the high priest;
\v 16 but Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the woman servant who was guarding the door and brought in Peter.
 
\s5
\v 17 Then the woman servant guarding the door said to Peter, “Are you not also
one of this man’s disciples?” He said, “I am not.”
\v 18 Now the servants and the officers were standing there; they had made a fire of coals, for it was cold, and they
were warming themselves. Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.
 
\s5
\p
\v 19 The high priest then asked Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.
\v 20 Jesus answered him, “I have spoken openly to the world; I was always teaching in synagogues and in the temple where all the Jews
come together. I said nothing in private.
\v 21 Why did you ask me? Ask those who have heard me about what I said. These people know the things that I said.”
 
\s5
\v 22 When Jesus had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand and said, “Is that how you should answer the high priest?”
\v 23 Jesus answered him, “If I have said anything bad, bear witness to the evil. However, if I have answered well, why do you strike me?”
\v 24 Annas then sent Jesus bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
 
\s5
\p
\v 25 Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. The people then said to him, “Are you not also
one of his disciples?” He denied it and said, “I am not.”
\v 26 One of the servants of the high priest, who was a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, “Did I not I see you in the garden with him?”
\v 27 Peter then denied again, and immediately the rooster crowed.
 
\s5
\p
\v 28 Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium. It was early in the morning, and they themselves did not enter the Praetorium so that they might not be defiled and so that they might eat the Passover.
\v 29 So Pilate went out to them and said, “What accusation are you bringing against this man?”
\v 30 They answered and said to him, “If this man were not an evil doer, we would not have delivered him up to you.”
 
\s5
\v 31 Pilate therefore said to them, “Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.” The Jews said to him, “It is not lawful for us to put any man to death.”
\v 32 They said this so that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, the word that he had said that indicated by what kind of death he would die.
 
\s5
\p
\v 33 Then Pilate entered the Praetorium again and called Jesus; he said to him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"
\v 34 Jesus answered, “Are you asking this of your own accord, or did others tell you to ask it of me?”
\v 35 Pilate answered, “I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me; what have you done?”
 
\s5
\v 36 Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not part of this world. If my kingdom were part of this world, then my servants would fight so that I should not be delivered to the Jews. Actually my kingdom does not come from here.”
\v 37 Pilate then said to him, “Are you a king then?” Jesus answered, “You say that I am a king. For this purpose I have been born, and for this purpose I have come into the world so that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.”
 
\s5
\v 38 Pilate said to him, “What is truth?”
 When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews and said to them, “I find no crime in this man.
\v 39 You have the custom that I should release to you one man at the Passover. So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”
\v 40 Then they cried out again and said, “Not this man, but Barabbas.” Now Barabbas was a robber.



\s5
\c 19
\p
\v 1 Then Pilate took Jesus and whipped him.
\v 2 The soldiers twisted thorns together to make a crown. They put it on Jesus' head and dressed him in a purple garment.
\v 3 They came to him and said, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and they struck him with their hands.
 
\s5
\v 4 Then Pilate went out again and said to the people, “See, I am bringing the man out to you so that you may know that I find no guilt in
him.”
\v 5 Jesus therefore came out; he was wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Then
Pilate said to them, “See, here is the man!”
\v 6 When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw Jesus, they cried out and said, “Crucify
him, crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no crime in him.”
 
\s5
\v 7 The Jews answered Pilate, “We have a law, and by that law he ought to die because he made himself the Son of God.”
\v 8 When Pilate heard this statement, he was afraid even more,
\v 9 and he entered the Praetorium again and said to Jesus, “From where do you come?” However, Jesus gave him no answer.
 
\s5
\v 10 Pilate then said to him, “Are you not speaking to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and 
power to crucify you?”
\v 11 Jesus answered him, “You would have had no power against me unless it had been given to you from above. So the person who delivered me to you has the greater sin.”
 
\s5
\v 12 At this answer, Pilate tried to release him, but the Jews cried out saying, “If you release this man, you are not Caesar’s
friend: Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.”
\v 13 When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down in the judgment seat in a place called The
Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.
 
\s5
\v 14 Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover, at about the sixth hour. Pilate said to the Jews, “See, here is your king!”
\v 15 They cried out, “Away with him, away with
him; crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Should I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but
Caesar.”
\v 16 Then Pilate turned Jesus over to them to be crucified.
 
\s5
\p
\v 17 Then they took Jesus, and he went out, carrying the cross for himself, to the place called The Place of a Skull,
which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.
\v 18 They crucified Jesus there, and with him two other men, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle.
 
\s5
\v 19 Pilate also wrote a sign and put it on the cross. There it was written: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\v 20 Many of the Jews read this sign because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. The sign was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.
 
\s5
\v 21 Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but rather that he said, ‘I am King of the Jews.’”
\v 22 Pilate answered, “What I have written I have written.”
 
\s5
\p
\v 23 After the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his garments and made four parts of them, a part for each soldier;
and also the shirt. Now the shirt was without seams, woven from the top throughout.
\v 24 Then they said to each other, “Let us not tear it apart, but instead let us throw lots for it to see whose it will be.” This happened so that the Scripture might
be fulfilled that said,
\q “They divided my garments among themselves,
\q and for my clothing they threw lots.”
\m
 
\s5
\v 25 The soldiers did these things. Jesus’ mother, his mother’s
sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene—these women were standing by the cross of Jesus.
\v 26 When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, “Woman, see, here is your son!”
\v 27 Then he said to the disciple, “See, here is your mother!” From that hour the disciple took her to his own
home.
 
\s5
\p
\v 28 After this Jesus, because he knew that all things are now finished, in order to make the Scriptures come true, said, “I am thirsty.”
\v 29 A container full of sour wine had been place there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop staff and lifted it up to his mouth.
\v 30 When Jesus had taken the vinegar, he said, “It is finished.” He bowed his head and gave up his spirit.
 
\s5
\p
\v 31 It was the Preparation, and in order that the bodies should not remain on the cross during the Sabbath (for
that Sabbath was an important day), the Jews asked Pilate that the legs of the executed men be broken, and
that their bodies might be taken down.
\v 32 Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the second man who had been crucified with Jesus.
\v 33 When they came to Jesus, they saw that he was already dead, so they did not break his legs.
 
\s5
\v 34 However, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately out came blood and water.
\v 35 The one who saw this has borne witness, and his witness is true. He knows that what he said is true so that you also may believe.
 
\s5
\v 36 These things came about so that the scripture might be fulfilled, “Not a single bone of him will be broken.”
\v 37 Again, another scripture says, “They will look at him whom they pierced.”
 
\s5
\p
\v 38 After these things Joseph of Arimathea, since he was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission. So Joseph came and took away his body.
\v 39 Nicodemus also came, he who at first had come to Jesus by night. He brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about one hundred litras in weigh.
 
\s5
\v 40 So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, as was the custom of the Jews to bury bodies.
\v 41 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden was a new tomb in which no person had yet been buried.
\v 42 Because it was the day of preparation for the Jews and because the tomb was close by, they laid Jesus in it.



\s5
\c 20
\p
\v 1 Now early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb; she saw the stone rolled away from the tomb.
\v 2 So she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and she said to them, “They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.”
 
\s5
\v 3 Peter and the other disciple then went out, and they went to the tomb.
\v 4 They both ran together; the other disciple outran Peter and arrived at the tomb first.
\v 5 He stooped and looked in; he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not yet go inside.
 
\s5
\v 6 Simon Peter then arrived after him and went into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying there
\v 7 and the cloth that had been on his head. It was not lying with the linen cloths but was rolled up in its place by itself.
 
\s5
\v 8 Then the other disciple went in also, the one who first arrived at the tomb; he saw and believed.
\v 9 For until that time they still did not know the scripture that Jesus must rise again from the dead.
\v 10 So the disciples went away again to their own homes.
 
\s5
\p
\v 11 However, Mary was standing outside the tomb weeping; as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb.
\v 12 She saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the foot, where the body of Jesus had lain.
\v 13 They said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have put him.”
 
\s5
\v 14 When she said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.
\v 15 Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? For whom are you looking?” She thought that he was the gardener, so she said to him, “Sir, if you have taken him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will take him away.”
 
\s5
\v 16 Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned herself, and said to him in Aramaic, “Rabboni,” that is to say, “Teacher.”
\v 17 Jesus said to her, “Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them that I will ascend to my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.”
\v 18 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples, “I have seen the Lord,” and that he had said these things to her.
 
\s5
\p
\v 19 When it was evening, on that day, the first day of the week, and while the doors were shut where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst of them and said to them, "Peace be to you."
\v 20 When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then when the disciples saw the Lord, they were glad.
 
\s5
\v 21 Jesus then said to them again, “May peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so send I am sending you.”
\v 22 When Jesus had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit.
\v 23 Whoever's sins you forgive, they are forgiven for them; whoever's
sins you keep back, they are kept back.”
 
\s5
\p
\v 24 Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
\v 25 The other disciples later said to him, “We have seen the Lord.” He said to them, “Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.”
 
\s5
\p
\v 26 After eight days again his disciples were inside, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came while the doors were shut, stood among them, and said, “May peace be with you.”
\v 27 Then he said to Thomas, “Reach here with your finger, and see my hands; reach here with your hand, and put it into my side; do not be faithless, but believe.”
 
\s5
\v 28 Thomas answered and said to him, “My Lord and my God.”
\v 29 Jesus said to him, “Because you have seen me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen, and yet have believed.”
 
\s5
\p
\v 30 Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, signs that have not been written in this book;
\v 31 but these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and so that as you believe, you may have life in his name.




\s5
\c 21
\p
\v 1 After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias; this is how he showed himself:
\v 2 Simon Peter was together with Thomas called Didymus, Nathaniel from Cana in Galilee, the 
sons of Zebedee, and two of Jesus’ other disciples.
\v 3 Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing.” They said to him, “We, too, will come with you.” They went and got into a boat, but all that night they caught nothing.
 
\s5
\v 4 When day was breaking, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus.
\v 5 Jesus then said to them, “Young men, do you have anything to eat?” They answered him, “No.”
\v 6 He said to them, “Cast your net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” So they cast their net, but they were not able to draw it in because of the quantity of fish.
 
\s5
\v 7 Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord.” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord,
he tucked up his outer garment about himself (for he had been very lightly clothed), and threw himself into the sea.
\v 8 The other disciples came in the boat (for they were not far from the land, about two hundred cubits off), and they were pulling the net full of fish.
\v 9 When they got out upon the land, they saw a fire of charcoal there and fish laid on it, with bread.
 
\s5
\v 10 Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.”
\v 11 Simon Peter then went up and drew the net to land, full of large fish, 153; although there were so many, the net was not torn.
 
\s5
\v 12 Jesus said to them, “Come and have breakfast.” None of the disciples dared ask him, “Who are you?” They knew it was the Lord.
\v 13 Jesus came, took the bread, and gave it to them, and the fish also.
\v 14 This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had risen from the dead.
 
\s5
\p
\v 15 After they had breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon,
son of John, do you love me more than these?” Peter said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” Jesus said
to him, “Feed my lambs.”
\v 16 He said to him again a second time, “Simon, son of John, love you me?” Peter said to him, “Yes, Lord; you
know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, “Tend my sheep.”
 
\s5
\v 17 He said to him a third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” Peter was sad because Jesus had said to
him a third time, “Do you love me?” He said to him, “Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.” Jesus
said to him, “Feed my sheep.
\v 18 Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to clothe yourself and walk wherever you wished; but
when you become old, you will stretch out your hands, and another person will clothe you and carry you where you will not wish to go.”
 
\s5
\v 19 Now Jesus said this in order to signal by what kind of death Peter would glorify God. After he had said this, he said to Peter, “Follow me.”
 
\s5
\v 20 Peter turned around and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them—the one who had also leaned back against Jesus’ breast at the supper and said, “Lord, who is the one who will betray you?”
\v 21 Peter saw him and then said to Jesus, “Lord, what will this man do?”
 
\s5
\v 22 Jesus said to him, “If I wish that he should wait until I come, what is that to you? Follow me.”
\v 23 So this statement spread among the brothers, that that disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to Peter that the other disciple would not die, but, “If I wish that he should wait until I come, what is that to you?”
\b
 
\s5
\p
\v 24 This is the disciple who bears witness about these things, and who wrote these things, and we know that his witness is true.
\v 25 There are also many other things that Jesus did. If each one were written down, I suppose that even
the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.
