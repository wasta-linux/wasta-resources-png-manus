\s5
\c 1
\p
\v 1 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace and peace to you.
\b

\s5
\p
\v 2 We always give thanks to God for all of you; we make mention of you
in our prayers.
\v 3 We remember without ceasing your work of faith, labor of love, and patience of confidence for the future in our Lord Jesus Christ before our God and Father.

\s5
\v 4 Brothers loved by God, we know your calling,
\v 5 how our gospel came to you not in word only, but also in power, in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance, even as you know what kind of men we were among you for your sake.

\s5
\v 6 You became imitators of us and of the Lord, as you received the word in much tribulation with joy of the Holy Spirit,
\v 7 so that you became an example to all in Macedonia and Achaia who believe.

\s5
\v 8 For from you the word of the Lord has rung out, and not only in Macedonia and Achaia—but in every place your faith in God has gone out, so that we do not need to say anything.
\v 9 For they themselves report concerning us, what kind of reception we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God,
\v 10 and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come.






\s5
\c 2
\p
\v 1 For you yourselves know, brothers, that our coming to you was not useless,
\v 2 but we previously suffered and were shamefully treated at Philippi, as you know. We were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God among much conflict.

\s5
\v 3 For our exhortation is not from error, nor from impurity, nor from deceit,
\v 4 but just as we have been approved by God to be trusted with the gospel, so we speak, not to please men, but God, who examines our hearts.

\s5
\v 5 For we did not at any time use words as flattery, as you know, nor as a pretext for covetousness, God is witness,
\v 6 nor did we seek glory from people, either from you or from others, when we could have claimed privileges as apostles of Christ.

\s5
\v 7 Instead, we were as gentle among you as when a mother comforts her own children.
\v 8 Thus we had affection for you; we were pleased to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become very dear to us.
\v 9 For you remember, brothers, our labor and toil: we worked night and day that we might not be a burden to any of you, as we preached to you the gospel of God.

\s5
\v 10 You are witnesses, and God also, how holy, righteously, and blamelessly we behaved ourselves to you who believe,
\v 11 just as you know how with each one of you, as a father with his own children, we exhorted and encouraged you and testified
\v 12 that you should walk in a manner that is worthy of God, who calls you to his own kingdom and glory.

\s5
\p
\v 13 For this reason we also thank God constantly, that, when you received from us the word of the message, the word of God, you accepted it not as the word of man, but, as it truly is, the word of God, that also works in you who believe.

\s5
\v 14 For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God that are in Judea in Christ Jesus, for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, as they did from the Jews,
\v 15 who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out, and who do not please God but are hostile to all people.
\v 16 They forbid us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved, to always fill up their sins. Wrath has come on them to the uttermost.

\s5
\p
\v 17 We, brothers, were separated from you for a short time, in presence, not in heart, and we did our best with great desire to see your face,
\v 18 because we wished to come to you, I Paul once and again, but Satan hindered us.
\v 19 For what is our confidence for the future, or joy, or crown of glorying—is it not you just as much as others—before our Lord Jesus at his coming?
\v 20 For you are our glory and our joy.





\s5
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Therefore, when we could no longer bear it, we thought it was good to be left behind at Athens alone.
\v 2 We sent Timothy, our brother and God’s minister in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and comfort you regarding your faith,
\v 3 that no one would be disturbed by these afflictions, for yourselves know that for this we are appointed.

\s5
\v 4 Truly, when we were with you, we told you in advance that we were about to suffer affliction, and it came about, as you know.
\v 5 For this reason, when I could no longer stand it, I sent that I might know about your faith, lest somehow the tempter had tempted you and our labor would be in vain.

\s5
\v 6 When Timothy came to us from you and brought us good news of your faith and love, that you always have good memories of us, and that you long to see us even as we also long to see you—
\v 7 because of this, brothers, we were comforted by you through your faith, in all our distress and affliction.

\s5
\v 8 For now we live, if you stand firm in the Lord.
\v 9 For what thanks can we give to God for you, for all the joy that we have  before our God over you?
\v 10 Night and day we pray very hard that we may see your face and provide what is lacking in your faith.

\s5
\p
\v 11 May our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you,
\v 12 and may the Lord make you increase and abound in love one toward another and toward all people, as we also do toward you
\v 13 May he do this in order to strengthen your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his holy ones.





\s5
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Finally, brothers, we encourage and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received instructions from us about how you must walk and please God, just also as you do walk—that you do even more.
\v 2 For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus:

\s5
\v 3 This is the will of God, your sanctification—that you abstain from sexual immorality,
\v 4 that each of you know how to possess his own wife in holiness and honor,
\v 5 not in lustful passion (as the Gentiles who do not know God),
\v 6 and that no man transgress and wrong his brother in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, just as we forewarned you and testified.

\s5
\v 7 For God did not call us to uncleanness, but to holiness.
\v 8 Therefore, he who rejects this rejects not people, but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you.

\s5
\p
\v 9 Regarding brotherly love you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another.
\v 10 Indeed, you do it to all the brothers who are in all Macedonia, but we exhort you, brothers, that you do it even more.
\v 11 We also exhort you to aspire to be quiet, mind your own business, and work with your hands, just as we commanded you.
\v 12 Do this so that you may walk properly in respect to those who are outside the faith, and so that you may have need of nothing.

\s5
\p
\v 13 We do not want you to misunderstand, brothers, about those who sleep, so that you do not grieve like the rest who do have no certainty of the future.
\v 14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him.
\v 15 For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left at the coming of the Lord, will surely not precede those who have fallen asleep.

\s5
\v 16 For the Lord himself will descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.
\v 17 Then we who are alive, who are left, will together with them be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.
\v 18 Therefore, comfort one another with these words.





\s5
\c 5
\p
\v 1 Now concerning the times and seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you.
\v 2 For you yourselves know perfectly well that the day of the Lord is coming like a thief in the night.
\v 3 When they say, "Peace and safety," then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman, and they will in no way escape.

\s5
\v 4 But you, brothers, are not in darkness so as for that day to overtake you like a thief.
\v 5 For you are all sons of the light and sons of the day. We are not sons of the night or the darkness.
\v 6 So then, let us not sleep as the rest do, but let us keep watch and be sober.
\v 7 For those who sleep do so at night, and those who get drunk do so at night.

\s5
\v 8 But since we are sons of the day, let us be sober; let us put on the breastplate of faith and love, and, for a helmet, the certainty of future salvation.
\v 9 For God did not destine us for wrath, but for the obtainment of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
\v 10 who died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.
\v 11 Therefore comfort one another and build each other up, just as you already do.

\s5
\p
\v 12 We ask you, brothers, to acknowledge those who labor among you and who are over you in the Lord, who exhort you.
\v 13 We also ask you to consider them highly regarded in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.
\v 14 We exhort you, brothers: warn the disorderly, encourage the discouraged, support the weak, be patient toward all.

\s5
\v 15 See that no one pay back evil for evil to anyone, but always strive for what is good for one another and for all.
\v 16 Rejoice always,
\v 17 pray without ceasing,
\v 18 in everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.

\s5
\v 19 Do not quench the Spirit.
\v 20 Do not despise prophecies.
\v 21 Test all things; hold on to that which is good,
\v 22 Avoid every kind of evil.

\s5
\p
\v 23 May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

\v 24 Faithful is he who calls you, who will also do it.

\s5
\p
\v 25 Brothers, pray also for us.
\p
\v 26 Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.
\v 27 I request of you by the Lord that this epistle be read to all the brothers.
\p
\v 28 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
