<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="Adapt Adapting Adaptation"></A>
- <B>Adapt</B>, <B>Adapting</B>, <B>Adaptation</B> are words that
refer to translating the words and phrases of a <A HREF="#Source Text (Adapt It)"><B>source
language text</B></A> into a <A HREF="#Target Text (Adapt It)"><B>target
language text</B></A>. Usually adaptation of texts assumes that the
structure (ordering) of the target language is similar to the
structure of the source language. Adapting usually results in a
target text that is a rough draft which will need revision, testing,
checking and polishing before it can be published or used widely. See
<A HREF="#Adapt It"><B>Adapt It</B></A>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="Adapt It"></A><IMG SRC="Glossary_Images/adaptit.png" NAME="graphics9" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32 BORDER=0>-
<B>Adapt It</B> is a computer program that is designed especially for
national translators. Adapt It helps its user <A HREF="#Adapt Adapting Adaptation"><B>adapt</B></A>
the text of a second language into his/her own mother tongue (first
language). The language the user is adapting from is known as the
<A HREF="#Source Text (Adapt It)"><B>source language</B></A>. The
text that the user is adapting into is known as the <A HREF="#Target Text (Adapt It)"><B>target
language</B></A>. Adapt It works best when the user knows the source
and target languages well (bilingual), and when the source and target
languages are similar or related languages. See <A HREF="#Source Text (Adapt It)"><B>Source
Text</B></A>. See <A HREF="#Target Text (Adapt It)"><B>Target Text</B></A>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="Alt (key)"></A>- <B>Alt</B>
(key) on a computer keyboard is used to change (alternate) the
function of other pressed keys. <IMG SRC="Glossary_Images/AltKey.gif" NAME="graphics8" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=107 HEIGHT=81 BORDER=0>Thus,
the Alt key is a modifier key, used in a similar fashion to the <A HREF="#Shift (key)"><B>Shift</B></A>
key. For example, simply pressing the A key will type the letter a,
but if you hold down either Alt key while pressing A, the computer
will perform an <KBD CLASS="western">Alt</KBD>+<KBD CLASS="western">A</KBD>
function, the effect of which varies from program to program. You can
also call it the <SPAN STYLE="font-variant: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Alternate

File</B> An <B>archive file</B> is a file that is composed of one or
more computer files along with information about those files
(metadata). Archive files are used to collect multiple data files
together into a single file for easier portability and storage, or

<A HREF="#Character"><B>characters</B></A> available for creating
text files in computers. Representing the characters (alphabet) of a
language with ASCII characters is only suitable for English and some
other European languages that do not require very many special
characters. For other languages that require special or complex
characters, a more flexible and complete standard is used called
Unicode. See <A HREF="#Unicode"><B>Unicode</B></A>.</P>

then clean, quarantine or delete infected files if it finds them.
Linux systems like <A HREF="#Linux Mint"><B>Linux Mint</B></A> don't
really need to run Anti-Virus all the time because viruses don't
generally infect Linux computers like they do Windows computers.
Linux Mint does have an Anti-Virus program called <B>ClamTK</B> (Menu

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="Backlight"></A>- <B>Backlight</B>
is the light that makes a computer's <A HREF="#Screen"><B>screen</B></A>
light up. It is called a backlight because the light appears to come
from the back of the screen. The intensity of the backlight can be
adjusted by pressing and holding down the <A HREF="#Fn (key)"><B>Fn
key</B></A> (at lower left) while pressing the <B>F8</B> or <B>F9</B>
function keys on the top row of keys. Each <B>Fn+F8</B> key press
decreases the backlight until it reaches a minimum amount of light;
each <B>Fn+F9</B> key press increases the backlight until it reaches
a maximum amount of light. Reducing the backlight is one way to
lengthen the time a laptop computer can run on a battery charge.</P>

(\) is a symbol that can be typed by using the key below the
<A HREF="#Backspace"><B>Backspace</B></A> key. The backslash symbol
is used to identify the markers used within the <A HREF="#USFM (Uniform Standard Format Markers)"><B>Unified
Standard Format Markers (USFM)</B></A> system of marking the parts of
Scripture text. <IMG SRC="Glossary_Images/BackSlashKey.gif" NAME="graphics6" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=99 HEIGHT=94 BORDER=0>The
<A HREF="#Adapt It"><B>Adapt It</B></A> and <A HREF="#Paratext"><B>Paratext</B></A>
programs both use texts that have USFM codes to mark things in
Scripture such as chapters (\c 1, \c2, \c3, etc), verses (\v 1, \v 2,
\v 3, etc), section headings (\s), and many other things. See the
document called usfmReference2_35.pdf for more information. You
generally won't have to worry about USFM backslash markers when using
Adapt It as long as the source texts used already have their USFM
markings. Paratext also can display the USFM markings when displaying
your Scriptures. Paratext also can create &quot;empty&quot; Scripture
books which have all the chapter (\c ) and verse (\v ) markers
already entered in the not-yet-translated Scripture book files. See
<A HREF="#USFM (Uniform Standard Format Markers)"><B>USFM</B></A>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="Backspace"></A>- <B>Backspace</B>
is the keyboard key that moves the display cursor one position
backwards, deletes the <A HREF="#Character"><B>character</B></A> at
that position, and shifts back the text after that position by one
position.<IMG SRC="Glossary_Images/BackspaceKey.gif" NAME="graphics5" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=123 HEIGHT=90 BORDER=0>
One way of &quot;deleting text&quot; is to position the display
cursor immediately to the right of what you want to delete, and then
use the Backspace key to delete characters backwards from the
starting point until what you want to delete is removed from the
text. See <A HREF="#Delete"><B>Delete (key)</B></A>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="Back Translation"></A>- <B>Back
Translation</B> is a special <A HREF="#Translation"><B>translation</B></A>
of your Scripture translation that you create in order to give to a
<A HREF="#Consultant"><B>translation consultant</B></A> to study
before he checks your translation. This back translation helps the
translation consultant (who does not know your language) to
understand more how your language works and how you've translated the
words and phrases of the Scriptures into your language. When it is
time for a consultant to check the translation, you or a person who
knows your language and either Tok Pisin or English, will need to
prepare a back translation written in Tok Pisin or English to give to
the consultant ahead of a consultant session. The back translation
must be prepared without referring to or looking at any other Bible.
A special back translation project can be created in <A HREF="#Adapt It"><B>Adapt

means sharing data together. <A HREF="#Adapt It"><B>Adapt It</B></A>
and <A HREF="#Paratext"><B>Paratext</B></A> can be set up to share
data automatically which greatly simplifies working with both Adapt
It and Paratext. An administrator sets up Adapt It and Paratext to
collaborate together. During the set up for collaboration, Paratext
is set up to have at least two Paratext Projects: a Source Language
Project, and a Target Language Project. The Source Language Project
will consist of the Scripture books (imported into Paratext) that
will be used to translate from during the adaptation process. The
Target Language Project in Paratext will consist mainly of the same
Scripture books - but in the target language project, they are
initially created as &quot;empty&quot; books within Paratext. As
adaptation work proceeds inside Adapt It, this Paratext Target
Language Project will automatically receive the adapted target text
produced during adaptation work within Adapt It. The administrator
sets up Adapt It to know what Paratext project is to be used for
obtaining its source texts, and which Paratext project is to be used
for storing its adapted target texts. A Project is established within
Adapt It for this language pair. Once this collaboration is set up,
Adapt It automatically handles all of the transfer of texts between
Paratext and Adapt It, and between Adapt It and Paratext. Working
entirely within Adapt It, the user selects the Scripture books and
adapts them to target text within Adapt It and the Paratext project
for receiving those target texts automatically grows until each
target text is completely created (from within Adapt It). Once the
adaptation process for a given book is complete, the user can switch
to Paratext, open the target language project where he will find the
adapted texts, and continue his work of editing and revising the
adapted texts - now from within Paratext only. The collaboration
setup process is described in detail in the
Help_for_Administrators.htm document. This document can be displayed
by making the Administrator menu visible from Adapt It (using the
&quot;Show Administrator Menu...&quot; selection on the View menu)
and then selecting the &quot;Help for Administrators (HTML)&quot;
menu item on the Administrator menu. See <A HREF="#Adapt It"><B>Adapt

it needs to be uncompressed or unzipped. Usually the Linux system
will know how to uncompress or unzip one of these files if you
right-click on the file within the File Manager and select &quot;Open

Bar</B> (in Adapt It) is an optional edit box that is normally hidden
but can be made available by selecting &quot;Compose Bar&quot; on
Adapt It's View menu. The <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Compose
Bar</SPAN> is a handy place for you to type any text you might like
to type, without having to worry about where the phrase box is. For
example, you m<IMG SRC="Glossary_Images/ComposeBar.gif" NAME="graphics2" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=515 HEIGHT=129 BORDER=0>ight
be working on a complex adaptation for a whole sentence, and wish to
work it all out before you enter it into the document. Click the View
menu's Compose Bar command a second time and it will disappear (its
contents will be retained though). Removing a <A HREF="#Retranslation (in Adapt It)"><B>retranslation</B></A>
also results in the retranslated text being copied to the Compose
Bar, in case you want to retain it temporarily. Most people never use
the Compose Bar, so unless you feel it will be important for your
work, you can just forget about it and it will stay hidden.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="Consistent Changes (CC)"></A>-
<B>Consistent Changes</B> (CC) Adapt It has the full-featured SIL
consistent changes application incorporated within it. Adapt It
allows you to specify from one to four consistent change tables,
which will be used sequentially when Adapt It copies source text to
make it the default target text - whenever an adaptation for the
source text at the active location is not known. You do not have to
use consistent changes when you use Adapt It, if you do not want to.
This functionality is, however, very powerful and highly useful if
you have a lot of known changes which are regular – especially
<B>orthography (alphabet) </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">changes</SPAN>;
it can save you lots of time manually typing adaptations.</P>

or the computer's <A HREF="#Operating System"><B>operating system</B></A>
itself quits suddenly or hangs up and no longer responds to your
commands at the keyboard or actions you take with the mouse pointer.
Sometimes a crash means that the program itself has a &quot;bug&quot;
and needs to be fixed or updated by the <A HREF="#Program or Computer Program"><B>programmer(s)</B></A>
who created the program. Another reason that a computer program might

<B>Ctrl</B> (key) is located at the lower left part of the keyboard.
The Ctrl key can be used along with other keys to give special
commands or short cuts to the <A HREF="#Program or Computer Program"><B>program</B></A>
that is running on the computer. For example, you can give the Ctrl+S
command (by holding down the Ctrl key while pressing the S key, then
releasing both keys) while creating a document in LibreOffice Writer.
The command tells Writer to save your work immediately. The Ctrl+S
command is simply a keyboard short cut for selecting the Save menu
item on Writer's File menu. Another example of how the Ctrl key is
used is to select some text in Writer, and give the Ctrl+B command.
The selected text is made <B>Bold</B> by that command. The Ctrl+B
command is simply a keyboard short cut for selecting the Bold icon on
Writer's formatting tool bar. There are many other short cut commands
that you can memorize to make your work go faster Many of the short
cut commands are listed on a program's menus, and in the
documentation files.

want to move the cursor over a button or other control and then press
the left-mouse button (or the left trackpad button) to activate that
control. Often you will move the cursor over a text - in which case
the cursor will change from an arrow shaped pointer to a pointer that
looks like the capital letter <B>I</B> <SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">(called
the I-beam cursor). You can then position the I-beam cursor between
the letters of the text and click the left-mouse button (or left

<B>Double-click</B> (with a mouse) is clicking the left <A HREF="#Mouse"><B>mouse</B></A>
button (or left trackpad button) twice in quick succession. A
double-click a short-cut way of <A HREF="#Select or Selection"><B>selecting</B></A>
an item and having some effect on that item. For example, <A HREF="#Double-click"><B>double
clicking</B></A> on a <A HREF="#Icon (computer)"><B>program icon</B></A>
on the <A HREF="#Desktop (computer interface)"><B>desktop</B></A>
does two things: It selects that program icon and starts up the
<A HREF="#Program or Computer Program"><B>program</B></A> associated
with that icon. A double-click can also be done on a word of <A HREF="#Text or Text File"><B>text</B></A>
in a word processor. When <A HREF="#Edit"><B>editing</B></A> text, a
double-click on a word highlights the whole word, and makes the word
be in <A HREF="#Focus or Control Focus"><B>focus</B></A> for the next
action taken, such as deleting the whole word or typing a different
word in its place. Some people have difficulty in doing a
double-click, because to be a true double-click, the clicks must be
done quickly with the left mouse button while holding the mouse
still. If the mouse moves between the clicks, the attempted
double-click will be understood as two single clicks in different
places on the screen. See <A HREF="#Click"><B>Click</B></A>.</P>

something and then holding the left mouse down on the selected thing
while dragging the thing to a different place, or on top of a
different thing. For example, Drag and Drop is one way to move
selected <A HREF="#Text or Text File"><B>text</B></A> from one place
in a text to another place within the text. Drag and Drop can also be
used within the <B>File Manager</B> to move selected <A HREF="#File or Disk File"><B>files</B></A>
and/or <A HREF="#Folder"><B>folders</B></A> from one place to another
place within the same file system (device). Drag and Drop takes
understanding, skill and good mouse control to do accurately and
effectively, especially when using it with files or folders.
Therefore for inexperienced users, it is usually better to do a <A HREF="#Copy (file)"><B>Copy</B></A>
and <A HREF="#Paste (files or text)"><B>Paste</B></A> operation or a
Cut and Paste operation instead. It is important to realize that when
one or more files or folders are selected, that a Drag and Drop
operation MOVES them when done within the same file system, but a
Drag and Drop done with selected files or folders does a COPY
operation when done across different file systems (devices) such as
between your computer and a USB thumb drive. See <A HREF="#Mouse"><B>Mouse</B></A>.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="Export"></A>- <B>Export</B> is
a way to get data out of a program, in a form that is designed to be
imported (opened) for use within another program. For example, Adapt
It has an Export-Import menu in its <A HREF="#Menu Bar"><B>menu bar</B></A>
that lists 6 kinds of exports, one of which is Export Translation
Text. The Export Translation Text (with the RTF button selected) can
be used to produce a nicely formatted (<A HREF="#RTF (file extension)"><B>RTF</B></A>)
document that can be opened within LibreOffice Writer and printed for
village testing. Note: You do not have to export adapted translation
text from Adapt It in order to get it into Paratext. This can be done
automatically when an administrator sets up collaboration between
Adapt It and Paratext. See <A HREF="#Collaboration Between Adapt It and Paratext"><B>Collaboration
Between Adapt It and Paratext</B></A>. Other types of exports from
Adapt It include: Export Source Text, Export Interlinear Text, Export
Glosses as Text, Export Free Translations, and Export Knowledge Base.

you are interested in Astronomy. Within the Ubuntu Software Center
you can click on the category &quot;Science and Engineering&quot; and
then click on the category &quot;Astronomy&quot;. There you will find

programs is called &quot;Stellarium&quot;. If you have Internet
access this program can be downloaded and installed. Note: Some
programs like Stellarium are large programs. Stellarium is about 36

the Internet from one part of the world to another part of the world

around the world via different routes, but they all get reassembled
together when they reach their destination - usually within a second

The majority of active malware threats today are usually worms or

has been designed to be a very secure computer system, and so there
are very few kinds of malware or viruses that can &quot;infect&quot;

malware is often present. See also <A HREF="#Hoax Emails"><B>Hoax

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="Menu (in task bar)"></A>- <B>Menu</B>

of the <A HREF="#Screen"><B>computer screen</B></A>. Most of the
computer programs that are available in <A HREF="#Linux Mint"><B>Linux

starting with a <A HREF="#Mouse"><B>mouse</B></A> <A HREF="#Click"><B>click</B></A>
on the <A HREF="#Menu (in task bar)"><B>main</B> <B>Menu</B></A>.
Keep your <A HREF="#Mouse"><B>mouse</B></A> still after clicking on
the word Menu, since it may take a few seconds for the main Menu to
appear. A<IMG SRC="Glossary_Images/MenuIconInPanel.png" NAME="graphics25" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=383 HEIGHT=51 BORDER=0>nother
way to invoke the main Menu is to press and release the <A HREF="#Menu (key)"><B>&quot;Menu&quot;
key</B></A> that is located between the left <A HREF="#Ctrl (key)"><B>Ctrl</B></A>
and <A HREF="#Alt (key)"><B>Alt</B></A> keys at the lower left part
of the keyboard (it has a picture of a 4-pane &quot;window&quot; on
the key). Once the main menu appears, it shows at least three columns
of menu <A HREF="#Icon (computer)"><B>icons</B></A> or menu
categories. The left column are icons which are called &quot;favorites&quot;.
These include the red coloured &quot;Quit&quot; icon at the bottom of
the column which is used to shut down the computer. You can hover the
mouse pointer over the menu icons and see a description of the menu
icon at the bottom (and bottom right) of the main menu. The middle
column lists the menu groups or menu categories. You can click on one
of these menu group names, and the list of icons representing the
menu items for that group will appear in the third or right column of
the main menu. As you hover the mouse pointer over each menu group
(in the middle column) the list of individual menu icons in the right
column changes - showing the icons contained in that group. If you
see the icon for a program you want to start up in the right column
of the main menu, you will find it helpful to first click on the
group name in the middle column to tell the computer that you are
interested in selecting a program icon belonging to that group (in
the right column). The computer will then make it easier for you to
move your mouse over to the right column and select one of the icons
of that group. You may need to practice this technique so that you
can accurately navigate through the Linux Mint Menu system with your
mouse, <A HREF="#Touchpad or Trackpad"><B>trackpad</B></A> or
<A HREF="#Pointing Stick"><B>pointing stick</B></A>. In this
Glossary, we indicate a series of menu commands by separating them

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><A NAME="Menu Bar"></A>- <B>Menu Bar</B>
A program's menu bar contains a list of menu names such as File Edit
View, etc. Menu bars are part of individual computer <A HREF="#Program or Computer Program"><B>programs</B></A>
such as Adapt It, Paratext or LibreOffice Writer. The menu bar is
located at the top of the program's <A HREF="#Window"><B>window</B></A>
frame just under the frame's <A HREF="#Title Bar"><B>Title bar</B></A>.
You &quot;open&quot; the menu by <A HREF="#Click"><B>clicking</B></A>
once on the name of the menu in the menu bar causing the menu's
sublist of items to open, allowing you to <A HREF="#Select or Selection"><B>select</B></A>
one of those items. In some programs, there are some menu items that
have additional (third-level) sublists. If an item in the menu's
sublist has a small right arrow at the right side of that menu item,
an additional third-level list of menu items will appear to the right
of the first list when you hover the mouse pointer over the menu
item. In such cases, if you want to select an item from that
third-level list, you must be careful to move the mouse pointer
directly to the right over that little arrow in order to be able to
click on a third-level list item, and avoid accidentally closing that
additional list. Adapt It does not have third-level menu lists, but
some other programs like Paratext and LibreOffice Writer do.

was designed for exclusive use by Bible <A HREF="#Translation"><B>translators</B></A>
and their advisors and <A HREF="#Consultant"><B>consultants</B></A>.
The reason for this restriction is because Paratext includes access
to some Bible resources and <A HREF="#Text or Text File"><B>texts</B></A>
whose copyright owners do not allow the free distribution of those
resources and text, but allow Bible translation workers to use them
if they agree to not give them away. Therefore, to use Paratext the
user must request a registration and agree to its <A HREF="#License (software)"><B>license</B></A>
terms which restrict you from giving copies of Paratext and its
resources to someone not involved in Bible translation work. The
Paratext program will not work unless your registration data has been

then click on the &quot;Do a Retranslation&quot; tool bar icon. The
retranslation is marked in a different color and is signaled by

your work often. Most programs have a Save item on their File menu.
You can also save your work using a Ctrl+S key short cut (Press the S
key while holding the <A HREF="#Ctrl (key)"><B>Ctrl</B></A> key
down). If a program experiences a &quot;<A HREF="#Crash"><B>crash</B></A>&quot;
(quits suddenly while you are working) some information or data may
not be saved since your last save operation. Some programs like Adapt
It and LibreOffice Writer will auto-save your work every 10 or 15
minutes unless you do a save operation more often. Paratext has an
auto-saving feature that will save your work when you change to a
different book or chapter. You can turn auto-save on by ticking a
check box in the Paratext menu: Tools &gt; Options.</P>

Bulk Email </B>is an email <A HREF="#Message"><B>message</B></A> that

to many email users. Spam email attempts to get a computer user to
respond to the email in a way that will only benefit the spammer, and
often be harmful to the user or the user's pocketbook. Spam relies on
deception, emotional stories, or outright lies to trick people into
responding to the email by replying to the email or by clicking on a
link within the email message. The link within spam email messages
usually takes the user to a <A HREF="#Website Web World Wide Web (www)"><B>web</B>
<B>site</B></A> that the spammer designed to look genuine (like a
familiar bank or store's web site) but is in reality just a deception
(called &quot;phishing&quot; web site), designed to get the user to
give away his identity or sensitive information such as <A HREF="#Password"><B>passwords</B></A>.
The spammers can then use that information to steal from people, or
even break in to the user's computer and control it, often using your
computer as a bot or robot to send spam to other people - often to
people on your own email address list. Spammers use computers to
collect email addresses from chatrooms, web sites, customer lists,
newsgroups, and <A HREF="#Virus"><B>viruses</B></A> which harvest
users' address books, and are sold to other spammers. Email spam is a

order to spread to other computers. Often, a worm uses a computer
